    <p><i>Abstract</i>: Unlike his dream theory and theory of archetypes, Carl&nbsp;Jung&rsquo;s notion of
    synchronicity hasn&rsquo;t met with success. The metaphysical system surrounding the hypothesis includes notions of
    supernaturalism (transcendence). This is a religio-philosophical viewpoint, rather than a scientific. The
    deleterious consequences are obvious. It undermines scientific respectability, promotes superstition, and has
    kindled obsolete polytheistic ideas in the post-Jungians. There is to date no scientific evidence to support
    synchronicity. But the strongest argument against the synchronistic notion is the fact that it hasn&rsquo;t proved
    helpful in any respect. Jung&rsquo;s unitarian model of the human Self is criticized. The Self really consists of
    two complementary aspects, a worldly and a spiritual, reminiscent of the Christological notion of hypostatic union.
    This would call for an altered view of reality, according to a paradigm of &ldquo;dual wholeness&rdquo;.<br>

    <p style="margin-top:20px;"><span class="shead">Introduction</span></p>
    <p>Synchronicity is defined as a meaningful coincidence of causally unrelated events. C.&#8239;G.&nbsp;Jung
    accounts for an exemplar synchronicity involving a grouping of events:</p>
    <blockquote>
      On April 1, 1949, I made a note in the morning of an inscription containing a figure that was half man and half
      fish. There was fish for lunch. Somebody mentioned the custom of making an &ldquo;April fish&rdquo; of someone.
      In the afternoon, a former patient of mine, whom I had not seen for months, showed me some impressive pictures of
      fish. In the evening, I was shown a piece of embroidery with sea monsters and fishes in it. The next morning, I
      saw a former patient, who was visiting me for the first time in ten years. She had dreamed of a large fish the
      night before (1978, p.&#8239;521).
    </blockquote>
    <p>A more amusing example of synchronicity is when my brother Bj&ouml;rn, together with a friend, visited Rome.
    This was in 78 or 79. While walking along the street, he saw in the distance the name of a pub and spelled it out
    aloud: &ldquo;<i>The Pink Elephant.</i>&rdquo; Immediately an angry voice exclaimed from behind: &ldquo;<i>THANK
    YOU VERY MUCH!!</i>&rdquo;&#8239;&mdash;&thinsp;as he turned around, behind him stood a huge American man clad in a
    pink suit. The &lsquo;meaning&rsquo; associated with the synchronistic event is not of the ordinary kind but stems
    from &lsquo;objective knowledge&rsquo;, resident in the <i>unus mundus</i>. It denotes a transcendent continuum
    that underlies both matter and psyche. It is metaphysically neutral layer of existence that is referred to by the
    adjective <i>psychoid</i>. It manifests in the synchronous occurrence of physical and mental (qualitative) events.
    The psychic qualities of <i>number</i> are especially significant as the most fundamental of its manifestations in
    the temporal sphere. The word <i>transcendent</i> should be understood in the Kantian sense as meaning
    &lsquo;beyond the limits of all possible experience and knowledge&rsquo;. <span class="nobr">M-L von Franz</span>
    says:</p>
    <blockquote>
      Inner and outer facts then behave as if their meaningful relation were in some way known, but not to our personal
      consciousness. Differently expressed, a &ldquo;meaning&rdquo; manifests itself in synchronistic phenomena which
      appears to be independent of consciousness and to be completely transcendental. It consists of representational
      images (<i>simulacra</i>), and its appearance seems to be connected with the momentary activation of an archetype
      manifesting itself simultaneously in physical and psychic realms in the form of acausal orderedness. The meaning
      that unites these inner and outer happenings consists of knowledge unmediated by the sense organs. This quality
      of knowledge is what Jung calls &ldquo;absolute knowledge&rdquo;, since it seems to be detached from our
      consciousness (1974, pp.&#8239;199-200).
    </blockquote>
    <p>Accordingly, Jung says:</p>
    <blockquote>
      The &ldquo;absolute knowledge&rdquo; which is characteristic of synchronistic phenomena, a knowledge not mediated
      by the sense organs, supports the hypothesis of a self-subsistent meaning, or even expresses its existence. Such
      a form of existence can only be transcendental, since, as the knowledge of future or spatially distant events
      shows, it is contained in a physically relative space and time, that is to say in an irrepresentable space-time
      continuum (1978, p.&#8239;506).
    </blockquote>
    <p style="margin-top:20px;"><span class="shead">The metaphysics of synchronicity and causality</span></p>
    <p>Synchronicity is supposed to serve as a universal principle on a par with causality. Our scientific worldview
    has a metaphysical underpinning. Scientists believe sternly in metaphysical tenets, in the sense of &ldquo;golden
    rules of thumb&rdquo;, as they cannot do without them. Scientists make use of the causal principle because it is
    useful and brings good results. It is what underlies empirical proof. From this perspective, it is wholly
    justifiable to try and introduce a new metaphysical principle, such as synchronicity. But it only becomes valuable
    if it proves instrumental. If we are able to deliberate our psychological experiences in terms of synchronicity, so
    that it has both an explanatory and guiding value, then synchronicity will take root in public consciousness. Its
    usefulness will decide its value. For instance, if it proves helpful in understanding dreams, in patient therapy,
    or if it were capable of leading us home when astray in the wilds, then it would become equally celebrated as
    causality.<br>
    <br>
    Jung should have distinguished areas where it is possible to demonstrate the usefulness of synchronicity.
    Practicability is what determines its value, whereas empirical veracity is not an urgent issue. Since its
    practicability has still not been demonstrated, I have come to doubt its value. Jung&rsquo;s attempt to find
    scientific support for synchronicity wasn&rsquo;t successful. For example, his statistical studies of astronomical
    phenomena and their relation to wedlock are inconclusive (Jung, 1977b, pp.&#8239;494-509). Jung&rsquo;s writings on
    synchronicity are virtually void of evidence (cf. Clark, 1997,&nbsp;<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.20381/ruor-16388"
    title="Synchronicity and poststructuralism: C.G. Jung&#39;s secularization of the supramundane">here</a>). This,
    however, would not be a problem were Jung able to demonstrate the practicability of the synchronistic notion.
    Compare with the archetypal notion. It has proved quite instrumental in relation to mythological and unconscious
    material, such as dreams. Although the archetype, as such, cannot be confirmed empirically the unconscious psyche
    functions <i>as if</i> there were archetypes (cf. Winther, 2011a,&nbsp;<a href="animism.htm" title=
    "The animistic archetypal nature of the unconscious">here</a>). This is really all we need to know. Thanks to this,
    we are capable of understanding <i>how</i> things work, which is essential from a scientific point of view. A
    scientist needn&rsquo;t know <i>what</i> a natural law is, in itself, or prove that it exists, as such. A scientist
    can make use of the predictive capacity of the law of gravity whether or not the graviton particle has been
    empirically detected.<br>
    <br>
    It is a similar issue with causality. A minimum requirement is that the universe works <i>as if</i> there were such
    a principle as causality. This is good enough. Philosophers can go on for ever discussing the metaphysical nature
    of causality, but scientists needn&rsquo;t bother. They are happy as long as they can find good use for it. It is
    an heuristic stance. Comparatively, it&rsquo;s not possible to observe &lsquo;energy&rsquo;, as such. It always
    turns out to be little electrons, or photons, etc., but nowhere is energy-as-such to be seen. Regardless,
    scientists time and again make use of the energy concept on account of its heuristic value. They apply laws to it,
    such as the &ldquo;conservation of energy&rdquo;, i.e, that energy can never be destroyed but only shift form. What
    proves that these are &ldquo;mere&rdquo; metaphysical tenets, i.e. &ldquo;golden rules of thumb&rdquo;, is that
    they turn out to be imperfect. Causality breaks down in quantum physics, since there exist events that are
    unconnected by a causal line. Does energy exist, as such, or does the universe behave <i>as if</i> there were such
    an entity as energy, or is it all in the mind? Philosophers can go on discussing this forever, but it is no big
    concern of the scientist. He is happy as long as he can utilize the abstract notion to predict the outcome of
    experiments. A gradual process will lead to a better understanding of &lsquo;energy&rsquo;. These principles are
    very useful; but there seems to be no useful application for synchronicity.</p>
    <p><span class="shead">Alternative explanations</span></p>
    <p><span class="nobr">M-L von Franz</span> writes:</p>
    <blockquote>
      By synchronistic events are also meant such well-known occurrences as were collected by W.&nbsp;von&nbsp;Scholz,
      among others. For example, he recounts: &ldquo;A man is journeying from Norderney to Helgoland. During the
      crossing, impelled by no outer event, he tells how many years ago the paddle wheel was broken during the same
      crossing. At this very moment a crash is heard&#8239;&mdash;&thinsp;the paddle wheel of the ship is
      shattered.&rdquo; Here the narrators fancy, coming from within, coincides with the actual event taking place a
      few seconds later. (1974, pp.&#8239;6-7)
    </blockquote>
    <p>An explanation that is more easily accessible is that the passenger has unconsciously registered a small change
    in the sound, or in the vibrations in the boat, indicating that something is wrong. This stirred up the memory of
    the earlier accident. It seems like proponents of the synchronistic theory underestimate our capacity of
    unconscious perception and cognition. Before the storm that fell upon southern Sweden in January 2005, it was
    observed how wild animals gathered in the open fields, while the humans had no inkling about the scope of the
    coming disaster. The animals knew intuitively that the trees would come crashing down. So, contrary to their
    natural habit, they abandoned their hiding-places in the wood.<br>
    <br>
    There are many alternative explanations to strange coincidences. It could be an effect of unconscious psychological
    expectancy. People tend to unconsciously choose their fate. Another factor is the rationalizing propensity of the
    human mind to find meaning and significance where there is none, denoted &lsquo;apophenia&rsquo; (<a href=
    "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apophenia" title="Apophenia">here</a>). It could also depend on the phenomenon of
    foresight, i.e., the capability to transcend time and see the future, to a limited degree. This idea is explicated
    by J.&#8239;B.&nbsp;Priestley in &ldquo;Man and Time&rdquo;. J.&#8239;W.&nbsp;Dunne investigates coincidences from
    another perspective than synchronicity, and speculates in our ability to transcend time (<a href=
    "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_William_Dunne" title="John William Dunne">here</a>). An extra time arrow is a
    justifiable scientific notion. Theoretical physicist Itzhak&nbsp;Bars has tried to discern how a second dimension
    of time could help physicists better explain the laws of nature (Siegfried, 2007, <a href=
    "http://phys.org/news98468776.html" title=
    "A Two-Time Universe? Physicist Explores How Second Dimension of Time Could Unify Physics Laws">here</a>).<br>
    <br>
    Jung describes synchronistic events as rare, since they are the resultant effects of the constellation of
    archetypes. In Jung&rsquo;s theory, an archetype is constellated when it has become energized for whatever reason,
    and shines stronger than other archetypes. Still, Jung regarded the method of divination, known as I&nbsp;Ching, as
    building on synchronicity, and he often experimented with the yarrow stalks (cf. Jung, 1969, pp.&#8239;589-608,
    <a href="http://www.iging.com/intro/foreword.htm" title="Foreword by Carl Gustav Jung">here</a>). This creates a
    theoretical difficulty, because one cannot expect the archetypes of the collective unconscious to constellate
    simply because one opens the book of I&nbsp;Ching. Thus, the notion of synchronicity seems hard to combine with
    divination practices. Nevertheless, Jung believes that synchronicity is what underlies mantic practices. He also
    keeps returning to astrological synchronicity despite the deterministic character of astrology.</p>
    <p><span class="shead">The metaphysics of monism</span></p>
    <p>In ancient times people were always aware of &ldquo;omens&rdquo;. The Romans employed bird-watchers,
    <i>augurs</i>, to observe what point of the compass the birds flew in (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augur"
    title="Augur">here</a>). This, they believed, would coincide with events in near future, such as the success of war
    missions, etc. The way the notion of synchronicity is employed bears a strong resemblance to the ancient notions of
    omen and portent. Arguably, synchronistic thinking represents a throwback to an ancient frame of mind regarding the
    interrelation between soul and world. The incentive behind this is to bring back &lsquo;meaning&rsquo; to the
    cosmos. The notion of synchronicity is predicated on Jung&rsquo;s monistic (unitarian) worldview. He theorized that
    the outer world and the psyche have a common background that transcends the world, denoted &lsquo;unus
    mundus&rsquo;, a term deriving from medieval Scholasticism and alchemy. The psychoid archetype resides in this
    layer, which is neither material nor psychic. The psychoid layer manifests itself in the synchronistic event, as
    the event is concurrently psychic and material. It represents a form of &lsquo;neutral monism&rsquo;, with the
    caveat that it relies on absolute transcendence. Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy says:</p>
    <blockquote>
      Neutral monism is a monistic metaphysics. It holds that ultimate reality is all of one kind. To this extent
      neutral monism is in agreement with idealism and materialism. What distinguishes neutral monism from its better
      known monistic rivals is the claim that the intrinsic nature of ultimate reality is neither mental nor physical.
      (Stubenberg, 2014, <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/neutral-monism/" title="Neutral Monism">here</a>)
    </blockquote>
    <p>The unus mundus as a metaphysical concept allows for a worldview in which &lsquo;psyche&rsquo; is intrinsic to
    the cosmos, unlike the worldview of materialism in which psyche is secondary to matter. Jung often returned to the
    story of the rainmaker as retold by Richard&nbsp;Wilhelm, the sinologist and missionary:</p>
    <blockquote>
      There was a great drought where Richard Wilhelm lived in China. There had not been a drop of rain and the
      situation became catastrophic. The Catholics made processions, the Protestants made prayers, and the Chinese
      burned joss sticks and shot off guns to frighten away the demons of the drought, but with no result. Finally the
      Chinese said, &lsquo;We will fetch the rain maker.&rsquo; And from another province, a dried up old man appeared.
      The only thing he asked for was a quiet little house somewhere, and there he locked himself in for three days. On
      the fourth day clouds gathered and there was a great snowstorm at the time of the year when no snow was expected,
      an unusual amount, and the town was so full of rumors about the wonderful rain maker that Wilhelm went to ask the
      man how he did it. In true European fashion he said: &lsquo;They call you the rain maker, will you tell me how
      you made the snow?&rsquo; And the little Chinaman said: &lsquo;I did not make the snow, I am not
      responsible.&rsquo; &ldquo;But what have you done these three days?&rdquo; &lsquo;Oh, I can explain that. I come
      from another country where things are in order. Here they are out of order, they are not as they should be by the
      ordnance of heaven. Therefore the whole country is not in Tao, and I am also not in the natural order of things
      because I am in a disordered country. So I had to wait three days until I was back in Tao, and then naturally the
      rain came.&rsquo; (Jung, 1977a, pp.&#8239;419-20)
    </blockquote>
    <p>This exemplifies Jung&rsquo;s ideal of individuated man whose soul connects with the outer world through
    synchronicity. On this view, the condition of the inner psyche is equally important as the material world.
    William&nbsp;James&rsquo;s neutral monism is what inspired Jung&rsquo;s neutral archetypal foundation of existence.
    The psychoid layer is an unconscious, impersonal, and spiritual stratum, constituting the foundation of both psyche
    and matter. Thus, the world is one. According to Jung, the archetype, as such, transcends both the psychic and the
    temporal sphere. That&rsquo;s why the archetype is capable of connecting the psychic and the temporal worlds in a
    meaningful coincidence. Jung&rsquo;s notion of the archetype, as such, has a Kantian flavour (&ldquo;Ding an
    sich&rdquo;, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant" title="Immanuel Kant">here</a>). As the archetype
    inhabits the psychoid layer it forever transcends the categories of consciousness.<br>
    <br>
    There is a logical problem with things-in-themselves, i.e., things that are by nature forever barred from human
    consciousness. How can anything be, on principle and forevermore, non-observable? If we say that something is, by
    definition, non-observable, it implies that the preexistence of form is postulated, because there must exist
    <i>something</i> that the mind is not capable of observing. It also means that there is a secret connection between
    human mind and transcendent reality, considering that the latter always knows to keep itself hidden. It behaves
    like a squirrel that hides behind the tree when you walk by. How can we postulate such a strange notion? Arguably,
    I can only say that it transcends my faculties for the time being, but in the future I might have acquired the
    ability to see what I can&rsquo;t see today. Similarly, we are today capable of observing the ultraviolet patterns
    on flowers that were earlier only visible to insects and certain birds. So, the notion of a &ldquo;potential
    existence that is, by its very nature, non-observable&rdquo; is illogical, it seems. Metaphysical transcendence is
    really a religious concept. Kantian philosophy went aground on the reef of the <i>noumenon</i> and the
    <i>thing-in-itself</i>. I fear that the same thing will happen to the paradigm of the <i>unus mundus</i>, as it
    depends on notions of absolute transcendence. Jungian analyst Marilyn&nbsp;Nagy says that &ldquo;I have identified
    Jung as belonging to the epistemological tradition whose most prominent members were Kant and Plato&rdquo; (Nagy,
    1991, p.&#8239;46). She says she was very downcast when she realized how dependent Jung was on the Platonic
    conception. Yet, Plato, to his defence, does not entertain notions of a radical metaphysical alterity.</p>
    <p><span class="shead">The return of polytheism</span></p>
    <p>The archetype of natural number takes up a special place in the metaphysic of Jung and von&nbsp;Franz. They came
    to view the whole numbers as common ordering factors of psyche and matter. As such they represent the most
    fundamental of psychoid archetypes. Jung says:</p>
    <blockquote>
      [S]ynchronicity, though in practice a relatively rare phenomenon, is an all-pervading factor or principle in the
      universe. i.e., in the <i>unus mundus</i>, where there is no incommensurability between so-called matter and
      so-called psyche. Here one gets into deep waters, at least I myself must confess that I am far from having
      sounded these abysmal depths.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection I always come upon the enigma of the <i>natural number</i>. I have a distinct
      feeling that number is a key to the mystery, since it is just as much discovered as it is invented. It is
      quantity as well as meaning. For the latter I refer to the arithmetical qualities of the fundamental archetype of
      the so-called Self (monad, microcosm, etc.) and its historically and empirically well-documented variants of the
      Four, the 3&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 and the 4&nbsp;-&nbsp;1. (von&nbsp;Franz, 1974, pp.&#8239;9-10)
    </blockquote>
    <p>This feature is reminiscent of polytheism. To the Maya, the number gods ruled existence. Every day and every
    cyclic event of time was ruled by a particular number deity, such as the god&nbsp;&lsquo;1&rsquo; the
    god&nbsp;&lsquo;2&rsquo;, etc.</p>
    <blockquote>
      The stela script records a sacred religious foundation, for gods of time and number are included in the texts of
      most carved monuments. Pure number was accorded considerable potency in ancient Maya religious thought. Each
      number was conceived as a god with particular characteristics: youth or old age, gender, degree of sexual
      prowess&#8239;&mdash;&thinsp;just about every range of human personality trait that one could catalog. For
      example, thick-lipped, his face spotted with tattoos, the god of the number two symbolized death and sacrifice;
      and the wrinkled countenance of number five reminds us of the wisdom of old age. Zeroes are represented by full
      figures with their hands clasped against their jaws to denote completeness of a full body count of twenty. Like
      the codices, the stelae evoke both performance and poetics. People once likely stood in the vast open spaces in
      front of these number gods chanting their names in the hope that their intervention in daily affairs would lead
      to a better life.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;Divine number seems to have made the passage of time possible, for the number gods often are depicted
      in full figure carrying the burden of the days. The weight of time is parceled out into <i>tuns</i>,
      <i>katuns</i>, and <i>baktuns</i> (scores of <i>katuns</i>), with the gods of number sharing the load in the
      relay. (Aveni, 1998, pp.&#8239;324-25)
    </blockquote>
    <p>It&rsquo;s no wonder that Jung&rsquo;s metaphysical system has religious overtones, since it relies on absolute
    transcendence. Arguably, in order to achieve a meaningful world Jung has conflated many notions from the scientific
    and religious realms. As I&rsquo;ve explicated earlier, in order to follow the scientific paradigm it&rsquo;s good
    enough if the archetypal and synchronistic notions prove to be instrumental. On the other hand, if they are
    hypostatized as entities residing in an archetypal otherworld (unus mundus), we have infringed upon a
    religio-philosophical worldview. No doubt, Jung has appropriated religious and scientific concepts and subjected
    them to psychologization. In the place of a split world, Jung has created a monistic world of meaning. But when
    concepts are torn out of context they tend to be misinterpreted. Jung claims that the notion of synchronicity
    derives from the Chinese. However, it is not wholly clear that the Tao and its workings overlap with the unus
    mundus and synchronicity. After all, Taoism is a spiritual teaching whereas Jung&rsquo;s notions are formulated in
    a psychological framework. Jung&rsquo;s philosophy is reminiscent of the overblown systems of the romantic era,
    formulated by thinkers such as Schopenhauer and Hegel. The latter spoke of the Absolute Spirit underlying
    existence, which drives history towards a goal. Such philosophical systems have not many followers today and
    represent a blind alley in human thought. They gave rise to much evil, such as Marxism.<br>
    <br>
    In ancient antiquity people still maintained a polytheistic frame of mind. During that age, unlike today,
    synchronistic phenomena in the sense of omen and portent made much sense. Polytheism builds on the identification
    of deities with the powers of nature. For instance, regularity of the tides depends on the benevolence of Poseidon,
    and falling in love depends on the divine intervention of Eros. Today, we believe that the moon&rsquo;s gravity and
    hormonal releases in the brain are responsible for these natural powers, respectively. So we have lost the ancient
    way of seeing things, in the way of a spiritual world which remains one, in which synchronicity could find a place.
    The conditions aren&rsquo;t right, anymore, for such a notion to take root in public consciousness.<br>
    <br>
    The polytheists, such as the Maya, were especially interested in the cyclic regularities of nature. They thought
    that a divine will was responsible for nature&rsquo;s repeated occurrences. Whenever an astronomical cycle, such as
    the synodic period of the planet Mars, came close to its end, it was necessary to placate the god and make
    sacrifice, in order for the cycle to recur. Otherwise chaos threatened. In Taoism, the naive anthropomorphic
    pantheon of gods is largely abandoned and replaced with a multilateral divine will named the Tao. It is up to
    humanity to remain in harmony with Tao by way of contemplation, which is a less naive form of sacrifice. Instead of
    sacrificing blood, the contemplative sacrifices his time and concentrative effort for the sustainment of the divine
    will. Due to this effort of harmonization, the Tao, which represents orderliness, will impact reality and put
    things right. Arguably, the divine prerogative of orderliness in Taoism corresponds with the cyclic regularities in
    Mayan culture.<br>
    <br>
    These are religious worldviews in which meaning prevails, and in which the world is still characterized by oneness.
    Jung, as it were, uses the same mould and recasts it, this time employing a psychological medium, in lieu of the
    ancient spiritual medium. The result is a composite metaphysical construct, a <i>complexio oppositorum</i>, which
    cannot take root in the modern soil, because modern people have lost the polytheistic mindset. Of course, it is no
    longer the question of belief in gods and spirits. Instead, we are persuaded to believe in world-transcendent
    archetypes harbouring psychological qualities, such as the quality of number. Synchronicity could, in a sense, be
    viewed as an intervention by a deity in that a certain archetype is said to be active at the time of the
    synchronistic event. Thus, an archetypal power is believed to underlie the event that introduces meaning and
    orderliness into the world, which is close to the polytheistic conception. Evidently, it is an inherent fallacy of
    Jungian psychology, in itself, which has allowed the regress that has occurred in James&nbsp;Hillman and the
    post-Jungians. The centrality of individuation in Jungian psychology poses a great stumbling-block. Individuation
    is only an alternative to a portion of the population; the rest must needs identify with a group and emulate a
    collective personality. This is problematic from a Jungian perspective, as the theory aspires at universality.
    Hillman and his Archetypal Psychology tries to meet this demand by a polytheistic throwback.</p>
    <blockquote>
      [When] the monotheism of consciousness is no longer able to deny the existence of fragmentary autonomous systems
      and no longer able to deal with our actual psychic state, then there arises the fantasy of returning to Greek
      polytheism. (Hillman, 1992, p.&#8239;27)
    </blockquote>
    <p>A return to the antique frame of mind, on lines of Hillman, is implausible, as modern people are disinclined to
    interpret the regularity and orderliness of reality as predicated on placable spiritual powers (cf. Winther, 1999,
    <a href="hillmcrit.htm" title="Critique of Archetypal Psychology">here</a>). Such a paradigm shift is bound to fall
    flat, as was also the fate of the Flower Power movement. Evidently, there is in Jungian psychology a romantic and
    polytheistic bias, which is quite detrimental, since it gives rise to regressive movements. This romantic
    inclination is evident in the curious topicality of Jung&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Red Book&rdquo;, and the wooly and
    superstitious quality of synchronicity. Gary&nbsp;Lachman discusses synchronicity in his biography of Jung:</p>
    <blockquote>
      For anyone hoping to find a clear, unambiguous statement about [synchronicity], it&rsquo;s a frustrating work.
      Jung&rsquo;s most important remark on it <i>can</i> be found, but it is embedded in some of his most tortuous
      Herr Doctor Professor prose, and it leaves us no nearer to an explanation for this baffling
      phenomenon.&nbsp;[&hellip;] Other writers, equally open to the reality of synchronicity, complain that Jung lumps
      practically <i>all</i> paranormal phenomena under its banner. As with the archetypes and the collective
      unconscious, it became a kind of one-size-fits-all means of explaining a host of different experiences, a
      tendency that has only increased by <i>synchronicity&rsquo;s</i> adoption into common usage (nowadays, whenever
      anything &ldquo;weird&rdquo; happens, people often say &ldquo;Wow, what a synchronicity.&rdquo;) Of the examples
      of synchronicity Jung gives, only one meets the requirement of &ldquo;meaningful coincidence,&rdquo; while the
      rest can be accounted for by ESP, telepathy, precognition, astrology, and other paranormal abilities. Readers
      unfamiliar with parapsychology came away from the book with the idea that the remarkable results J.&#8239;B.&nbsp;Rhine was getting at Duke University with his experiments in ESP were examples of
      synchronicity. Ones that were familiar with it shook their heads when Jung chalked up an example of precognition
      or telepathy to his all-purpose &ldquo;acausal principle.&rdquo; (Lachman, 2010, ch.&#8239;8)
    </blockquote>
    <p style="margin-top:20px;"><span class="shead">Synchronicity in a psychodynamic light</span></p>
    <p>Psychoanalyst Gibbs A. Williams (2010) has researched synchronicities in his own experience and in patients.
    Although he rejects Jung&rsquo;s supernaturalism and instead views synchronicity as a naturalistic and
    deterministic phenomenon, he argues that they are functional properties of a mind seeking wholeness. He concludes
    that Jung&rsquo;s view of synchronicity as an <i>acausal</i> phenomenon is unwarranted. He also criticizes the way
    in which Kantian noumenal nature (absolute transcendence) is described in fine detail, although this should be
    impossible. Williams has found that what for most people is &ldquo;a coincidence perceived as evoking little or no
    particular meaning; the same occurrence for another person (or the same person at a different time) may be
    perceived as a pivotal life defining experience&rdquo; (p.&#8239;112). Says Williams:</p>
    <blockquote>
      Synchronicities occur in a psychological state of deprivation, devitalization of the spirit, alienation,
      psychological gridlock, generating a wish to be meaningfully connected with or to something or someone that is
      solid, trustworthy, consistent, reliable, and responsive. (Williams, 2010, p.&#8239;204)
    </blockquote>
    <p>Coincidences happen all the time. The psychological need of personality at the moment attributes to each of them
    a special divine significance, which is likely to be caused by an overestimation of a particular detail coincident
    with subjective facts. Thus, the subjective perception of coincidences represents a function of the psyche to seek
    ways out of a dilemma. The divided personality experiences an intensified need and wish to make meaningful
    connections, which underlies the heightened sensitivity to meaningful connections. Thus, &ldquo;synchronicities
    grow out of the soil of psychic conflict&rdquo; and are intimately involved with a felt need for significant
    psychological change and transformation. Says Williams: &ldquo;Viewing the production of meaningful coincidences
    from the vantage point of a science of psychodynamics indicates that they are associated with significant
    psychological change and transformation of the self&rdquo; (p.&#8239;291). Viewing synchronicities as
    self-generated messages, accentuated by unconscious projection, leads the patient or therapist to make as many
    meaningful associations with the material as possible. This is a rather different standpoint than standing in awe
    before a message that is supposed to derive from the transmundane orb.</p>
    <p><span class="shead">Theory of mind</span></p>
    <p>Jesse Bering (2012) explains that understanding other minds is very central to evolved human psychology. We
    assume an &ldquo;intentional stance&rdquo; when reasoning about others, which implies that we have evolved the
    capacity to reason about the unobservable mental states of other beings. However, we do not only interpret the
    mind-states of persons, but also of animals, artifacts, and natural events. To treat the entity as an agent serves
    to predict and to explain its actions and motives. It enables us to learn and therefore to make more appropriate
    responses in the future. This specifically human capacity, lacking in animals, has been strongly favoured by
    natural selection (cf. Bering, 2012, Kindle Loc.&#8239;313f).</p>
    <blockquote>
      We are exquisitively attuned to the unseen psychological world. Theory of mind is as much a peculiar trademark of
      our species as is walking upright on two legs, learning a language, and raising our offspring into their
      teens.&nbsp;[&hellip;]<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;[Our] theory of mind is applied not only to the mental innards of other people and animals, but also,
      in error, to categories that haven&rsquo;t any mental innards at all&hellip; (Kindle
      Loc.&#8239;541-565)&nbsp;[&hellip;]<br>
      Just as we see other people as more than just their bodies, we also tend to see natural events as more than
      natural events. And again, this seeing beyond the obvious is the consequence of the very peculiar way our brains
      have evolved, with a theory of mind. At every turn, we seem to think there are subtle messages scratched into the
      woodwork of nature, subtle signs or cues that God, or some other supernatural agent, is trying to communicate a
      lesson or idea to us&#8239;&mdash;&thinsp;and often to us alone. Usually, it&rsquo;s about how we should behave.
      So we listen attentively, effortlessly translating natural events into divine or supernatural messages. (Kindle
      Loc.&#8239;1166f)
    </blockquote>
    <p>Superstitious beliefs are often viewed as a childish mode of thinking. However, to perceive any event as
    meaningful, that is, as representing certain unobservable mental states that predicate the event, requires a theory
    of mind. Thus, contrary to the common assumption, it requires a cognitive skill that is not present in children up
    to a certain age (cf. Kindle Loc.&#8239;1441-1456). Bering concludes that, &ldquo;before the age of seven,
    children&rsquo;s minds aren&rsquo;t quite cognitively ripe enough to allow them to be superstitious thinkers&rdquo;
    (Kindle Loc.&#8239;1482f). This, however, changes drastically when the child has acquired a full-fledged theory of
    mind. Our cognitive system is dedicated to forming illusory representations of all kinds. Says Bering:</p>
    <blockquote>
      Isn&rsquo;t it astounding how all the convoluted, endless paths of thought, all the divine wild goose chases ever
      known or to be known, begin and end with the same cognitive capacity&#8239;&mdash;&thinsp;the theory of mind?
      (Kindle Loc.&#8239;1643f)
    </blockquote>
    <p>Because &ldquo;everything happens for a reason&rdquo; we also tend to create a narrative, a mythology, of our
    lives that accords with Jung&rsquo;s notion of individuation, i.e., that we have been created for a special purpose
    (cf. Kindle Loc.&#8239;2431ff). The conclusion is that our species is predisposed to formulate beliefs in the same
    vein as the theory of synchronicity. Such ideas are not simply errant ways of thought invented by religious
    charismatics. In fact, it is part of our nature to think in a religious way. According to Bering, &ldquo;culture
    develops and decorates the innate psychological building blocks of religious belief&rdquo; (Kindle
    Loc.&#8239;1835). These are adaptive illusions, because being observed by a supernatural audience promoted
    inhibitory decisions against ancestral biological drives, which in turn bolstered reproductive success. After all,
    being &ldquo;good&rdquo; would have been highly adaptive, especially since our verbal capacity of gossip often has
    the consequence of ostracism. Supernatural reasoning has served to restrain our selfish and impulsive behaviour,
    since it undermines the anonymity of the situation (cf. Kindle Loc.&#8239;2844f). Says Bering:</p>
    <blockquote>
      The cognitive illusion of an ever-present and keenly observant God worked for our genes, and that&rsquo;s reason
      enough for nature to have kept the illusion vividly alive in human brains. (Kindle Loc.&#8239;2912f)
    </blockquote>
    <p>On this view, God is an adaptive illusion, which means that the notion has been functional in human history.
    This opens up the question whether supernatural beliefs should be regarded <i>psychologically</i> real, in view of
    the fact that they have a pronounced effect on psychic and social life. After all, that which works is usually
    regarded real. Comparatively, our self-conscious ego is an illusion created by the brain. Although we know this,
    few people question the reality of their own ego. Maybe this is what Jesus means by &ldquo;faith&rdquo;, namely
    belief in that which doesn&rsquo;t (yet) exist, because it is functional and has a wholesome effect. After all, he
    seems to reject metaphysical conceptions of the Heavenly Kingdom and instead explains that it present inside us and
    all around us, as a function of faith. Thus, in the beginning it is only a mustard seed planted in the earth
    (Luke&nbsp;17:21; Matt.&nbsp;13:31, Thomas&nbsp;3).<br>
    <br>
    Following this line of reasoning, the theory of synchronicity rest upon &ldquo;the innate psychological building
    blocks of religious belief&rdquo;, that is, the innate archetypes of the unconscious. Jung has merely persevered
    with an archetypal pattern of thought that has continued since times immemorial. It follows that synchronicity is a
    cognitive illusion that has nothing to do with reality, as such.</p>
    <p><span class="shead">Two-unity</span></p>
    <p>If Jung&rsquo;s conglomerative worldview doesn&rsquo;t hold water, how can the collective loss of meaning and
    the split in the collective mind be remedied? In my article &lsquo;The Complementarian Self&rsquo; (2011b, <a href=
    "compself.htm" title="The Complementarian Self">here</a>) I argue that the structure of our psychological Self is a
    two-unity. The one side is spiritually oriented (trinitarian) whereas the other is worldly oriented (quaternarian).
    On this view, the Self is Janus-faced. The two sides are complementary, that is, either one of them represents an
    adequate ideal of Self. In other words, each is a wholeness, in itself. Each side is associated with a particular
    worldview and outlook on life, incommensurate with the other. Either side can serve as a model for the life of the
    individual. However, complementarity also means that something is amiss with either aspect of Self. Although either
    side represents completeness, it is not adequate as Self ideal during the entire life of the individual, and under
    all circumstances. At some point it is necessary to change outlook, i.e., to adopt the ideals of the complementary
    aspect of Self.<br>
    <br>
    This is borne out by the life experiences of regular people. Individuals who have accomplished much on the worldly
    scene may suddenly change their outlook. Occasionally, people even become world-denying ascetics. However, at a
    later stage the spiritual person sometimes takes the step to return to the world. But these changes needn&rsquo;t
    always be explicit and wholly obvious to the surrounding world. Such transformational phases are predicted by Asian
    spiritual traditions, such as Zen. Typically, at a certain stage the contemplative ascetic returns to the world and
    takes up a humble trade. In the &lsquo;Ten Zen Ox Pictures&rsquo; (<a href="http://swamij.com/zen-ox.htm" title=
    "Ten Zen Ox Pictures">here</a>), after having captured and tamed the sacred bull, the enlightened one
    &ldquo;returns to the marketplace of life, leading life in the world, yet also in the Self&rdquo;. Note that he is
    no longer interested in his own spiritual transformation; instead he affects the surrounding, and dead trees will
    turn green. The notion of two-naturedness is also evident in the traditions of aboriginal culture. Occasionally a
    member of a tribe dons the paraphernalia characteristic of the individual&rsquo;s totem, and turns into a spiritual
    person. This is his alternative Self, in the guise of a red cockatoo, for instance. He will insist, at the inquiry
    of the anthropologist, that he is indeed a red cockatoo. It is not just a masquerade.<br>
    <br>
    It seems that the human personality can harbour two different worldviews and alternate between them. While the one
    remains in the shadow (although not forgotten) the other basks in conscious sunlight. Yet, it&rsquo;s not possible
    to combine them, that is, to live them simultaneously, because they are mutually exclusive. After all, each Self
    aspect is complete, and personality cannot be more than complete. To combine them amounts to a regressive solution,
    causing an abatement of the conscious level, from a modern consciousness to an antique frame of mind. Arguably,
    this is the consequence if a worldview is created where the religious and spiritual outlook, and the worldly and
    scientific paradigm, are conflated. In that case, the conscious level must needs abate to a level characteristic of
    New Age or esoteric tradition. In traditional society there exists no strong distinction between the sacred and the
    profane. Only in an unconscious state may the opposites remain loosely united without flying apart.<br>
    <br>
    According to this model, the modern dividedness of personality is overcome by an alternation of personality over
    time. The complementary aspect of personality is allowed to slowly grow in the shadow, during which time it is
    continually furnished, metaphorically speaking, with just enough water and sunlight. The worldly oriented Self
    (quaternarian) coincides largely with the Jungian self, minus the superstructure of transcendental irrationality
    which amalgamates the sacred and profane according to traditional and obsolete ways. Jung overtly rejected
    traditional notions of religious faith, including contemplative ascetic practices. Instead, he reinstated the
    divine in another form. But my argument is that the mindset of faith belongs in the complementary aspect of Self,
    which Jung has excluded from his unitarian Self image. This depends on the fact that the two Self aspects are
    mutually exclusive. Jung concluded that the spiritual (trinitarian) Self is simply wrong. Thus, he resolutely threw
    the child out with the bathwater. It is not wrong, it is a complementary aspect to be lived to the full during
    another phase of life.<br>
    <br>
    The human brain is capable of sustaining two incompatible worldviews at the same time, making allowance for two
    irreconcilable Self aspects, provided that either one is kept more in the shadow for the time being. Although a
    spiritual worldview based on faith cannot be combined with a rational and scientific worldview, they may supersede
    each other. It is a twofoldness, i.e., a form of wholeness, that does not give rise to a neurotic conflict. In
    fact, the worldly personality is sustained by its spiritual counterpart. It represents the water hole of
    &lsquo;meaning&rsquo; that the individual can always return to. Because he knows that he has recourse to this
    alternative in the future, it only strengthens his resolve in the worldly sphere. His career and material success
    is not that important, a circumstance which tones down materialism and makes personality less obsessive. Most
    importantly, thanks to the complementary partition, the Self ideal according to which he lives is chiefly
    realizable. It is not self-contradictory, which is something that could give rise to a neurotic conflict.</p>
    <p><span class="shead">Critique of the unitarian Self</span></p>
    <p>Arguably, Jung to some extent misinterpreted his youthful experience of the two personalities (No.&#8239;1 and
    No.&#8239;2), as related in his autobiography (Jung, 1989). He came to understand No.&#8239;1 as ego and
    No.&#8239;2 as Self. Alternatively, they would represent two complementary aspects of Self, of which one remains in
    the shadow. Personality No.&#8239;1 was more extraverted, characterized by no-nonsense, whereas the No.&#8239;2 was
    more introverted and emotional. If No.&#8239;1 and No.&#8239;2 are viewed as complementary, they are capable of
    changing place: No.&#8239;2 takes precedence and No.&#8239;1 ends up in the shadow. This cannot occur in
    Jung&rsquo;s model, while No.&#8239;2 represents the one and only wholeness, whereas No.&#8239;1 is viewed as a
    kind of outgrowth on the psychic tree, known as the ego. From a complementarian viewpoint, the psyche may
    experience a reversal, whereby No.&#8239;2 becomes the new ideal. However, it would require a much different ego,
    much toned down and less expansive.<br>
    <br>
    Jung&rsquo;s unitarian Self is a &lsquo;complexio oppositorum&rsquo;, characterized by a strong inner tension. The
    Jungian Self combines the worldly personality with the spiritual. The ideal is to excel as a worldly and as a
    spiritual individual, simultaneously. It is the underlying rationale for Jung&rsquo;s metaphysical system that
    attempts to combine two mutually exclusive worldviews. Scientific ideas (such as the archetype) are being
    hypostatized while religious ideas are subjected to psychologization. It also explains the contradictory nature of
    Jung&rsquo;s writings. By example, although he professes a Platonic interpretation of the archetype, he also takes
    strong exception to such an otherworldly interpretation that relegates the idea to the &ldquo;unverifiable realm of
    faith and superstition&rdquo; (Jung, 1980, p.&#8239;75). Jung, it seems, tries to envelop all opposites. According
    to the complementarian notion, maximum selfhood as a spiritual person cannot occur simultaneously with maximum
    selfhood as a worldly person. They must occur consecutively. When either aspect is maximized, the other is
    minimized. As one aspect remains in the sunlight, the other must remain in the moonlit landscape of the
    unconscious, where it is potentiated with archetypal meaning. Yet, the hidden aspect of Self must not be allowed to
    go extinct, which would destroy the complementarian dynamic.<br>
    <br>
    A Self that harbours all opposites cannot be realized in the daylight world. The ego must needs be torn between the
    opposites. It stands to reason that it could be harmful as Self ideal, as there are limits to how much inner
    tension the conscious personality can carry. Jung&rsquo;s composite ideal explains why there is no room for the
    spiritual reclusive in Jung&rsquo;s model, that is, the personality who centers his life upon faith, purity,
    frugality, and simpleness. Jung rejects asceticism and the life of the contemplative, and therefore also rejects
    the philosophy underlying spiritual practices of the East, such as Yoga (cf. Jung, 1969, p.&#8239;484). The problem
    is, namely, that the gurus and the sadhus teach that the spiritual pupil must overcome the &ldquo;ego&rdquo;, and
    thus become absorbed in the Self. Jung&rsquo;s polemic is inadequate as it draws on the different meanings of
    words: &ldquo;if there is no ego there is nobody to be conscious of anything.&rdquo; In fact, from a Jungian
    perspective, an egoless state is out of the question as it is tantamount to psychosis.<br>
    <br>
    However, the notion of &ldquo;ego&rdquo; in traditional spiritual philosophy does not overlap with our Western
    notion. What spiritual teachers really mean is that the spiritual Self takes over from the worldly Self. The ego is
    still present, but it basks under another sun that shines with a different light, which transforms the ego and
    makes it unassuming and unassertive. It is evident from the Zen tradition (see above) that the seeker changes his
    perspective. It is as if he now looks at the world with a third eye, which sees the world differently. So it really
    signifies an alternation between the quaternarian and trinitarian Self aspects.<br>
    <br>
    Human beings are endowed with a Self that is a two-unity. Adjustment to the spiritual path necessitates that we
    absorb the spiritual worldview of faith and seclusiveness that is already present inside us as the trinitarian
    aspect of Self (the <i>ternarius</i>, using a medieval term). This spiritual pattern of personality is already
    inside us, from the beginning. It grows in the moonlight while we are busy with worldly matters. Jung&rsquo;s
    critical argument is really predicated on his own Self model. His position is that the Self is quaternarian, that
    is, committed to worldly realization of wholeness and completeness. The trinitarian Self of religious tradition,
    and the spiritual practices surrounding it, are incompatible with Jung&rsquo;s model and must therefore be
    rejected. It has been argued that Jung&rsquo;s position depends on a misreading of the Eastern traditions.
    Leon&nbsp;Schlamm says:</p>
    <blockquote>
      Welwood insists that meditation is a royal road to non-dualistic experience, rather than to a subterranean
      unconscious mind, revealing awareness of a unified field where divisions between subject and object, the inner
      world and outer reality, and consciousness and the unconscious, are recognized as possessing only conventional
      significance, but from the perspective of a higher order of truth of Buddhism simply do not exist. Such
      divisions, including Jung&rsquo;s division between ego and unconscious, are, for Welwood, symptomatic of the
      confused state of mind known in Buddhism as samsara.&nbsp;[&hellip;]<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;Mark Epstein, for example, has argued that, from the Buddhist perspective, it is mistaken to view
      egolessness as a developmental stage beyond the ego. During transpersonal states of consciousness the ego is not
      abandoned, nor completely transcended; rather, the spiritual practitioner realizes that the ego lacks concrete
      existence. It is not the ego that disappears; rather the belief in the ego&rsquo;s solidity, the identification
      with the ego&rsquo;s representations, is abandoned in the realization of egolessness during states of ordinary
      waking consciousness. (Schlamm, 2010)
    </blockquote>
    <p>It is evident that the trinitarian Self brings with it a quite different, &ldquo;non-dualistic&rdquo;, way of
    seeing reality. From a complementarian standpoint this is unobjectionable, seeing that its quaternarian
    complementary is retained, anyway. According to Jung&rsquo;s quaternarian standpoint the &ldquo;dualistic&rdquo;
    perspective does not at all represent a &ldquo;confused state of mind&rdquo;. We can accept both views, although
    they are mutually exclusive. Thus, we may solve this endless schism. But Jung&rsquo;s model is unitarian, which
    means that there cannot be two wholenesses in one Self, but only one. Accordingly, the trinitarian interpretation
    is rejected as erroneous. On the other hand, the teachers of the East regard Jung&rsquo;s worldview as a confused
    state of mind known as &lsquo;samsara&rsquo;. This is equally wrong.<br>
    <br>
    In order to postulate a unitarian Self and a monistic metaphysic Jung eliminates the transcendental Godhead. He
    discards the transcendental aspect of personality. It is a very radical step, considering that it is universally
    present in spiritual teachings around the globe. Nevertheless, in accordance with Jung&rsquo;s ideal of enveloping
    all opposites, he proceeds to postulate transcendence in a radical psychological form, i.e., as a
    &ldquo;psychoid&rdquo; form of transcendence. What constitutes the world according to Jung? It is neither <i>esse
    in re</i> nor <i>esse in spiritu</i>; rather it is <i>esse in anima</i>. His metaphysic and his writings are
    predicated on a Self that harbours irreconcilable opposites. The tree is known by its fruit. Evidently the Jungian
    Self has given rise to a cumbersome and self-contradictory theoretical construct. What&rsquo;s worse, the
    deleterious metaphysics in Jung&rsquo;s thought is the seed of the regressive movement that has occurred in Hillman
    and the modern polytheists. It is necessary to take this &ldquo;shadow&rdquo; of Jungian psychology to task because
    it leads to unconsciousness. Jung said that an increase in consciousness is critical for the survival of
    civilization; but the Jungian movement risks turning into its own opposite.</p>
    <p><span class="shead">The complementarian Self</span></p>
    <p>To adopt Jung&rsquo;s unitarian Self is to bite off more than one can chew. Theologians have presented a better
    Self model in the form of the <i>hypostatic union</i> of the two natures of Christ. Of course, since it is a model
    of Christ&rsquo;s nature and not of the human Self, we cannot expect the same laws to apply. Still, it lends
    credence to a complementarian interpretation of human personality. There is a clear resemblance between the
    hypostatic union and the complementarian Self. The Christ is wholly human and wholly divine. It is a Christological
    dogma; yet, Jesus&nbsp;Christ also serves as model personality for millions of people. It is probably true what
    Jung says, namely that the Christ image is too one-sidedly spiritual. Nevertheless, correctly understood,
    Christology lends credence to a balanced and complementarian Self image (cf. Winther, 2011b, <a href="compself.htm"
    title="The Complementarian Self">here</a>).<br>
    <br>
    The quaternarian Self aspect (<i>quartarius</i>) lets the ego focus on improvement and conscious expansion,
    including scientific understanding. During this phase one finds a place in the world and settles down. The
    quaternarian consciousness does not depend on transcendental notions, such as the unus mundus and synchronicity. It
    represents a pragmatic and rational attitude that contents itself with that which has heuristic value. The
    integration of the unconscious is central to the individual, who is devoted to the path of individuation. This Self
    aspect can be likened to a sun that has spots. It is necessary to integrate the dark sides of personality in order
    to exist in the world. Our dark and instinctual qualities, such as assertiveness, acquisitiveness, eagerness, and
    shrewdness, can be turned to the good, provided that they are acknowledged and remain under control. Quartarius
    would represent a scientific mindset, devoted to work.<br>
    <br>
    The trinitarian Self aspect (<i>ternarius</i>) allows notions of transcendency to come to expression, in a mature
    way. This is the way of the mystic, the ascetic, the artist, and the contemplative. The integration of the
    unconscious is no longer central. Instead, <i>complementation</i> is now the dominant exercise (cf. Winther, 2012,
    <a href="thanatos.htm" title="Thanatos - A contribution to the understanding of the collective shadow">here</a>).
    It might seem extravagant to introduce a new term; but I deem it valuable as a counterweight to the emphasis on
    integration in psychology. Integration means <i>conscious</i> integration whereas complementation is a process of
    <i>unconscious</i> integration during which consciousness fulfills a more passive role. In the ancient temple of
    Apollo, and among certain Gnostic sects, the initiate went through a process called &ldquo;incubation&rdquo;,
    during which he/she dwelled in darkness and silence for a period. The ritual of incubation, which also occurs among
    Amerindians, represents an important aspect of religious life, which today only continues among devoted
    mystics.<br>
    <br>
    The Gnostics set themselves the task of bringing back to the Pleroma the <i>divine sparks</i> that have fallen and
    are now imprisoned inside material existence. In fact, when the mystic tones down the light of consciousness, yet
    remains focused, he does exactly this. He sacrifices conscious light and thereby returns the divine sparks to their
    origin, thus reciprocating the sacrifice that was once made when the world was created. (The original
    world-creating sacrifice, when the gods sacrificed their life and limbs, is a central theme in religious
    mythology.) The contemplative stands aside from the stressful onrush of the world, devoting himself to spiritual
    practices, such as discursive mediation. In the Christian conception, sacrifice means that the devotee gives up
    his/her own life of the ego and may choose to live as cloistered contemplative. Thus, time and energy is devoted
    not to oneself and one&rsquo;s own well-being, but to God, in the form of prayer, etc. It is a religious mindset
    where faith plays a central part. However, it needn&rsquo;t be as austere as in medieval spiritual practices.<br>
    <br>
    There is One Self consisting of Two complementary wholenesses, symbolized by the numbers Three and Four. In logical
    terms, the complementarian Self is characterized by an <i>exclusive disjunction</i> (<a href=
    "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or" title="Exclusive or">here</a>). It is true if the operands, or
    disjuncts, have opposite truth values. A simple way to state this is <i>&ldquo;one or the other, but not neither
    nor both.&rdquo;</i> Interestingly, the logical operator for exclusive disjunction is <span style=
    "font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#8853;</span>. If <i>T</i> is ternarius and <i>Q</i> is quartarius, the
    complementarian Self is written as: <span style=
    "font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><i>T</i>&nbsp;&#8853;&nbsp;<i>Q</i>.</span></p>
    <p><span class="shead">Conclusion</span></p>
    <p>Because matter (&lsquo;mater&rsquo;&#8239;&mdash;&thinsp;mother) is fundamental to the universe, and ideas are
    viewed as secondary, the latter also become relativized. They are regarded as invented, and that&rsquo;s why no
    idea is seen as more objective than the other. What&rsquo;s absolute is only the stuff that makes up the world and
    what sustains us, such as foodstuff. Thus, the motherly principle becomes dominant, while the fatherly principle is
    undervalued. As a consequence, people become enmeshed in the mother complex. The consequence of one-sided
    materialism is that we are about to dive headlong into matriarchy. On the other hand, if the realm of
    ideas&#8239;&mdash;&thinsp;the spirit&#8239;&mdash;&thinsp;were fundamental to the universe, then it would function
    as a counterweight to matriarchy and relativism. The complementarian perspective postulates a spiritual
    complementarity. This is a working solution, unlike the unitarian perspective that conflates notions of
    transcendence with a worldly outlook.<br>
    <br>
    Synchronicity does not commend itself, it seems. Although coincidences are valuable to take note of, it
    doesn&rsquo;t mean that it should be seen as a principle of nature. Such events could equally well be purely
    coincidental, interpreted as intentional. Alternatively, they are parapsychological phenomena, such as the capacity
    to transcend time and unconsciously to foresee the future, to a degree. The capacity of unconscious perception, as
    observed in animals, must also be taken into account. Synchronicity is not really an explanation. It is a statement
    of just-so-ness, a mere statement of fact: a synchronistic event just occurred. Instead, it is hypostatized as a
    metaphysical statement about the nature of the universe. It is like a huge impersonal spirit, metaphysically
    neutral, capable of forging coincidences in its progeny, namely the material and psychic realms. Jung held that
    psyche is equally real as matter. But the monistic model (i.e., that they are inherently one) is problematic, it
    seems. Jung&rsquo;s metaphysic of an unus mundus and its concomitant principle of synchronicity remain sheer
    metaphysical speculation. He holds that the psyche has the same reality status as the outer world and achieves this
    by postulating a psychoid reality that underlies them both. It is a form of transcendental monism.<br>
    <br>
    In order to maintain wholeness and meaning in the universe it is not necessary to endorse a monistic metaphysic. In
    the complementarian model the psyche occupies a special place. Consciousness furthers a complementarian bipartition
    of the world, much like the role of the observer in quantum physics, who decides whether the phenomenon is a
    particle or a wave. The physicist chooses whether to be part of the material world of particles or the world of
    non-substantial waves. But he can&rsquo;t choose <i>both</i> alternatives at the same time. There is no monistic
    alternative, on lines of Jung. By way of analogy, the observer plays a central part in a complementarian
    metaphysic. This is central to my argument, although my sketchy thoughts about the role of the psyche in the
    complementarian paradigm need further elaboration.<br>
    <br>
    Synchronicity and the psychoid transcendental layer is the mortar that holds together Jung&rsquo;s edifice of
    metaphysical monism and unity of Self. The transcendental concept makes very much sense in the trinitarian
    paradigm, where God&rsquo;s being has <i>relative</i> transcendence, but it has no place in the quaternarian
    paradigm where it is logically inconsistent and incites the return of pagan ideas. Jung&rsquo;s world is
    characterized by wholeness. Yet, behind the drapery of advanced psychology it sanctions paganism, in the sense of
    Celtic or Roman polytheism. There is no reason to implant the archetype in a transcendental psychoid substratum in
    order to endow the archetype with reality-status, thereby to achieve &lsquo;absolute meaning&rsquo; and
    &lsquo;absolute knowledge&rsquo;. A trinitarian complementary reality is transcendentalism proper, and it is a
    wellspring of meaning.<br>
    <br>
    In the fairytale, the old king must step down in favour of the young stableman, who was chosen by the beautiful
    princess, because he has saved the kingdom from demise. The fairytale hero does not signify a human ego.
    <span class="nobr">M-L von Franz</span> holds that the emergence of the young king signifies that new ruling ideas
    will come to dominate collective consciousness. To maintain vitality and avoid stagnation, it is necessary to allow
    for new developments. To cling to old beliefs will lead to the demise of the kingdom. Only new ideas can save it.
    It is a misapprehension that critical views serve a destructive purpose. Rather, the incentive is to propose new
    ways of seeing things, which hopefully will contribute to the survival of the &ldquo;kingdom&rdquo; of Jungian
    psychology. The growth of superstition and obsolete polytheistic ideas are highly damaging to Jungian
    psychology.<br>
    <br>
    I hold that the metaphysical superstructure of synchronicity ought to be discarded. The notion is better used to
    denote interesting coincidences, viewed as quite mundane examples of unconscious intuitive foresight. In the
    complementarian model, the transcendental and psychoid aspect of the archetype has no place, because it fulfills no
    function. The complementarian model also warrants a way of life in which the individual refrains from realizing
    both aspects of the Self. Thus, it includes the great majority of people who have no propensity to walk the
    individual and the spiritual path. This solves the dilemma of elitism, which has been criticized in the Jungian
    model.</p>

    <p><span class="shead">The sacred and profane as complementary truths</span></p>
    <p>Jung&rsquo;s archetypal notion depends on the transmission of acquired traits, which was anathema in his own
    time (except in the Soviet union, during a time). The latest findings in epigenetics show that acquired traits are
    sporadically passed on to subsequent generations&#8239;&mdash;&thinsp;at a surprisingly high degree and at a high
    pace, to boot. Jung knew nothing about this. It undergirds the notion, forwarded by Jung, that our medieval history
    has forged our modern mentality. In my article, &lsquo;Understanding European Psychology&rsquo; (2011c, <a href=
    "interiority.htm" title="Understanding European psychology">here</a>), I discuss the psychological legacy of the
    medieval era. According to recent findings, human evolution has been moving at breakneck speed in the past several
    thousand years (Dunham, 2007, <a href=
    "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/12/10/us-evolution-human-idUSN1043228620071210?sp=true" title=
    "Rapid acceleration in human evolution described">here</a>. See also Science Daily article, 2010, <a href=
    "http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/12/091231164743.htm" title=
    "Evolution caught in the act: Scientists measure how quickly genomes change">here</a>, and EU Times article, 2007,
    <a href="http://www.eutimes.net/2007/12/why-the-human-race-is-growing-apart/" title=
    "http://www.eutimes.net/2007/12/why-the-human-race-is-growing-apart/">here</a>). Today, we are quite different from
    people living even a few thousand years ago. The new findings also show that the human genome in the different
    continents have diverged and continue to do so. It stands to reason that there are different variants of psychic
    structure in humankind, as genomic changes can occur within the time frame of a couple of thousand years.<br>
    <br>
    Moreover, it has been suggested that the findings of chaos theory, such as the phenomenon of &ldquo;strange
    attractors&rdquo;, could contribute to the understanding of archetypal determinants. We know today that nature,
    especially biological nature, makes use of fractal geometry. We only need a tiny seed, in the form of a very simple
    algorithm, that is repeated recursively, to create a very complex structure. Arguably, diverse psychic structures
    could emerge from simple seeds, too.<br>
    <br>
    Still, this is in the way of reductive science. It views the archetype as secondary to the physical world. Jung
    aimed to elevate the archetype as a reality in its own right. That&rsquo;s why he created his metaphysical system,
    where neither psyche nor matter takes precedence. However, his system smacks of 19th century idealistic philosophy.
    Hegel&rsquo;s philosophy relies on the existence of absolutes, embodied in a World Spirit that permeates reality.
    Hegel&rsquo;s dialectic is characterized as a three-step process, &ldquo;thesis, antithesis, synthesis&rdquo;. Jung
    was overly fond of this thinking.<br>
    <br>
    Jung failed in his attempt to authenticate the reality of the psyche. The modernized variant of 19th century
    metaphysical cosmogony didn&rsquo;t work. His synchronicity notion has proved fruitless and his Platonic metaphysic
    is abstruse. <span class="nobr">M-L von Franz,</span> in Number and Time (1974), fails in her attempt to clarify
    it. Of course, much of Jung&rsquo;s theory is quite valuable, but nobody seems to have lived through his programme
    of individuation: from the shadow, via the anima and the wise old man, to the Self. To my knowledge, nobody claims
    to have followed this path. Jung&rsquo;s notion of Self, which is extravagant and out of proportion, has
    contributed to the backlash to pagan beliefs.<br>
    <br>
    Carl Jung, in old age, realized that people had not been able to adopt his system. Towards the end of his life, he
    said: &ldquo;I have failed in my foremost task&#8239;&mdash;&thinsp;to open people&rsquo;s eyes to the fact that
    man has a soul, there is a buried treasure in the field, and that our religion and philosophy are in a lamentable
    state&rdquo; (Rolfe, &ldquo;Encounter with Jung&rdquo;, 1989). He also had a vision, or dream, in which he saw
    the whole earth scorched, and only a part of China had survived. Of course, according to Jung&rsquo;s view, the
    Chinese already employed the synchronicity notion, and the Tao would correspond to Jung&rsquo;s <i>psychoid</i>
    layer of &lsquo;absolute knowledge&rsquo;. This is perhaps the reason why only the Chinese could be rescued from
    annihilation, in the dream.<br>
    <br>
    I have tentatively suggested that there is a way out of this dilemma. According to the <i>complementarian</i>
    concept, the above physicalistic explanations of the archetype are wholly adequate. It is a standalone view of
    reality which is unobjectionable. Nevertheless, it needs to be complemented with another standalone view of
    reality, which is equally unobjectionable&#8239;&mdash;&thinsp;a world in which the spirit takes precedence. In
    this way, both psyche and archetype have acquired reality status, in a complementary fashion. If the archetype is
    secondary to matter in the worldly paradigm, it is viewed as primary in the spiritual paradigm. Thus, there are two
    different ways of looking at reality, both equally satisfactory.<br>
    <br>
    This is borne out by the perspective of the unconscious psyche, which aspires at independent reality status.
    Figures that appear in dreams insist that they are real. When people are about to die, a dream might express that
    now its time to travel to the Otherworld, as if existence could continue there. The unconscious is adamant about
    this perspective, which seems naive and animistic (cf. Winther, 2011a, <a href="animism.htm" title=
    "The animistic archetypal nature of the unconscious">here</a>). It is as if the unconscious psyche views itself as
    an independent reality in itself. From this perspective, the figures of the unconscious are &ldquo;entities of
    psyche&rdquo;, i.e., they have a light of their own, and a degree of free will. They correspond to psychic deities,
    in a sense, which is the picture that mythology relates.<br>
    <br>
    Although it is completely unscientific, it is a world picture relevant to human needs. According to the
    complementarian view, this is a worldview wholly adequate in itself, although not real in the physical sense. To
    view the archetype as autonomous mental being is wholly sufficient. There is no need to undergird it by recourse to
    abstruse metaphysics or reductive physicalistic science. If spirit is <i>viewed</i> as real ontic substance, it
    follows that there can be mental entities endowed with psychic qualities, such as a relative degree of
    consciousness and free will. On this view, that such psychic entities exist is as self-evident as the existence of
    stones in the materialistic paradigm. Thus, by applying a complementarian metaphysics the quandary can be elegantly
    solved. Although the physicalist perspective is retained, the psychic is granted a proper reality status as a
    complementary aspect of reality, simply because we are <i>living</i> it. Thus, there is no need to create an
    awkward conglomerative of matter and psyche, in the way of Jung&rsquo;s metaphysic.<br>
    <br>
    The models that attempt to explain archetypal nature are founded upon either the physicalist paradigm or the
    Jungian conglomerative metaphysic. The former has the advantage that it is academically inclined and intellectually
    sound. The latter has the advantage that it endows the archetype with ontological reality status, which is
    essential to Jungian psychology. However, it is intellectually ungainly and has reinforced an outdated way of
    thinking, along Neo-Pagan lines.<br>
    <br>
    The complementarian solution dispenses with the 19th century type of conglomerative metaphysics and separates the
    spiritual paradigm from the worldly, allowing reality status to each. However, it is characterized by an exclusive
    disjunction, that is, &ldquo;one or the other, but not neither nor both.&rdquo; In the life of the individual, the
    two aspects of reality are not parallel in time. It&rsquo;s not possible to live in both realities at the same
    time. Thus, one has to make a choice. It is borne out by the nature of the Self, which is complementary: one side
    of me is a worldly, highly curious and scientific person, eager for knowledge. Another side of me is a reclusive
    who would like to abandon this worldly strife and go live in a grotto on a mountain slope above the clouds (cf.
    Winther, 2011b, <a href="compself.htm" title="The Complementarian Self">here</a>).<br>
    <br>
    I do not only speak for myself. I know that this double-naturedness is prevalent and is not considered diseased.
    Rather, it is viewed as worthy of imitation. By example, the Roman emperors were typically very dutiful and
    ambitious bureaucrats (although we tend to hear only of the mad emperors, like Nero). After having ruled the world
    they would withdraw to their humble little country estate where they devoted themselves to growing cabbage. At
    least, this was the ideal. They were said to enjoy their &ldquo;otium cum dignitate&rdquo;. The preserved letters
    contain trivial matters of how they enjoy their little garden, etc. It is a remarkable shift in attitude, which is
    not uncommon in human nature. How is this possible, if there is no complementary aspect of Self? The twofold Self
    is associated with a twofold worldview. It cannot work with a monistic worldview, on lines of Jung&rsquo;s neutral
    monism. Nor does it square with the physicalistic monism of the materialistic scientists, or the idealistic monism
    of the philosophers.<br>
    <br>
    Is this a satisfying solution? Philosophically minded people will perhaps argue that it is a cop-out. It is not to
    the taste of people who would like to live in a unified world. Yet, the nub of the matter is that they may continue
    to live in a unified world; it&rsquo;s only that they must decide whether to belong to the one paradigm or the
    other, without rejecting the alternative paradigm. Science and faith ought to be viewed as parallel worldviews that
    aren&rsquo;t quite self-sustaining, in themselves, and therefore must be brought to completion by their
    counterpart. As a consequence, their respective paradigmatic status is maintained despite the fact that religious
    and scientific truth is relativized.<br>
    <br>
    A scientific worldview cannot take into account moral, spiritual, and psychological factors, as reality is
    portrayed without relation to the human soul. It implies that the scientific paradigm is not quite adequate as a
    worldview on its own. For instance, medieval paintings have a value perspective in which important persons look
    larger than others. This is a moral perspective that is equally relevant as the optical perspective, and it is not
    a sign that medieval man was ignorant. Again, science and faith ought to be viewed as parallel worldviews that
    aren&rsquo;t quite self-sustaining, in themselves, and therefore must be brought to completion by their
    counterpart. What I have in mind when I discuss the spiritual paradigm of faith, is primarily the mystical and the
    contemplative tradition, and not so much the exoteric and ritual tradition, which is characterized by a monistic
    metaphysic.<br>
    <br>
    <span class="shead">Biblical versus historical facts</span><br>
    <br>
    The complementarian perspective maintains the paradigmatic significance despite the fact that science and religion
    are regarded as relative, and not as absolute truths (i.e., as the one and only Weltanschauung). The biblical
    stories is a case in point, which illustrates this doubleness. The creation story is not a dogma of the church. It
    is not to be regarded as incontrovertible truth. Comparatively, while Christ&rsquo;s nature as wholly human and
    wholly divine is dogma and absolute truth, the biblical creation story is not. It is relative truth, and thus it is
    malleable and changeable. The biblical stories about Jesus are also to be viewed as truth with reservations. After
    all, they do not coincide perfectly.<br>
    <br>
    What are the historical facts about Jesus? It is evident from the bible that he took over the messianic movement of
    John the Baptist at the time when John was put in prison (Mark 1:14ff and Matthew 4:17ff). Jesus started his oeuvre
    by following in John&rsquo;s footsteps. He baptized people and preached in John&rsquo;s voice: &ldquo;Repent, for
    the kingdom of heaven is at hand.&rdquo; The disciples weren&rsquo;t all poor and unknowledgeable fishermen.
    Several of them were already members of the movement, and many were well-to-do. With all likelihood, Peter and
    Andrew already belonged to the Baptist messianists. Many of Jesus&rsquo;s disciples must already have been
    baptized, and they probably had great insight into the scripture.<br>
    <br>
    So, the Gospels have downplayed John the Baptist&rsquo;s role and the intellectual level of the disciples. In our
    scientific age we regard this as a deviation from the truth. But, in fact, the Gospels relate a deeper truth, and
    thus they give the true picture. If Jesus had been portrayed as second to John, it would have related a false
    picture. Jesus was second to nobody, not even the emperor of Rome. That&rsquo;s why we are told that Jesus built
    his own movement and that he had called his disciples from the unsophisticated and unknowledgeable people. It is
    truthful to portray the disciples as novices, considering that they had not yet heard the gospel of joy. As long as
    people haven&rsquo;t assimilated the teaching of Jesus Christ, they all remain at the stage of the novice.<br>
    <br>
    From a complementarian perspective, there is an historical truth and a spiritual truth. Both are valid in their own
    context. When he felt ripe for entering nirvana, the Buddha voluntarily lied down on his side, in a state of
    transcendental peacefulness. Yet, historical sources say that he died of food poisoning after having eaten at a
    restaurant (depending on tradition). This is neither a voluntary nor a pleasant way of entering nirvana. Anyway,
    tradition has it that he forgave the cook before dying. Again, there is a spiritual truth and an historical truth.
    However, the Buddhists seem untroubled by such discrepancies. Historically, people are accustomed to existing in a
    world without any strong distinction between the sacred and profane. It&rsquo;s a world where a pronounced
    spiritual-worldly dichotomy has not yet developed.<br>
    <br>
    In animistic society, at sacred occasions, the celebrants become one with their totem spirit, often in the guise of
    an animal. Their spiritual guise is regarded as equally real as their human nature. There is a double-naturedness
    to reality and there is a double-naturedness to the Self. In olden times, the two aspects of reality, although
    mutually exclusive, weren&rsquo;t experienced as conflicting, partly because both were given their due time, but
    also because logical contradictions are tolerable to pre-scientific consciousness. They represent different ways of
    looking at reality. Such a worldview still prevails among the Australian aborigines who live in the traditional
    way.<br>
    <br>
    The biblical creation story relates a truth that is complementary to scientific truth. The creation that took place
    before man&rsquo;s emergence on the sixth day, is handled concisely. It took only a couple of days. The underlying
    message is that history only began at the origin of human consciousness, at the day when we became modern human
    beings. If the whole timeline is laid down, mankind only emerges in the last minutes, from a geological
    perspective. Although it is historically true, it doesn&rsquo;t relate a truthful picture of this remarkable event,
    which is comparable to the emergence of Jesus in Galilee. Adam is first man, and Jesus&nbsp;Christ is Second Adam,
    that is, he is the first man in God&rsquo;s new creation. Thus, God renews his relation to mankind. In a sense, the
    emergence of human ego consciousness is a world-creating event. Only at this moment there is full awareness of
    Creation. Only at this point, when Adam and Eve opened their eyes, God begins to truly relate to his Creation. So,
    from a religious perspective, this is where history begins.<br>
    <br>
    What took place before, such as the age of dinosaurs, etc., can&rsquo;t really compare with these world-creating
    events. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s incorrect to argue that the religious authors were mistaken. They looked at
    reality with different eyes. In fact, the universe is still geocentric, and earth is still in its centre. Nobody
    can deny that the earth is central, considering that it means everything to us. The creation myth gives expression
    to this truth. What if the earth is the only place in the universe where ego consciousness has developed? It means
    that the earth remains at the center of the cosmos, not geographically but morally. As long as there is no proof of
    the opposite, the earth remains a very special place, and the geocentric perspective cannot be discarded. Not long
    ago scientists believed that the universe is stationary and has no beginning in time. In a sense, the bible was
    closer to the truth.<br>
    <br>
    Viewed from this perspective, the biblical creation story is highly relevant. From the standpoint of faith, history
    before man can be summarized as six days of divine creation. The authors of the Pentateuch conveyed the spiritual
    truth, because history only begins at the moment when we become aware of God, which coincides with the emergence of
    a full-fledged theory of mind. So remarkably important is this event. God sees himself through his relation to man,
    and so mankind mirrors God. The notion that man was created in the image of God relates an important truth. Had
    they written about the historical and geological truth, things would get the wrong proportions. Similarly, the
    authors of the Gospels corrected the historical facts and conveyed the real truth, which includes the real moral
    proportions. Paradoxically, these &ldquo;improvements&rdquo; make the Gospels appear authentic, since only real
    events need to be improved upon.<br>
    <br>
    The trinitarian and spiritual paradigm provides a perspective that always stands in relation to the human soul.
    However, the trinitarian paradigm isn&rsquo;t quite sufficient as self-contained solution. Worldly knowledge is
    needful, after all. In medieval times, the Christian church endorsed science. It seems like both paradigms, the
    sacred and the profane, present a worldview that aspires at completeness. Nevertheless, it turns out that only the
    complementary perspective can mend the holes.<br>
    <br>
    The gist of the idea is the following. Not only is the sacred and the profane capable of existing side by side in
    society, but they may also find expression in the same person. They are mutually exclusive as worldviews, but over
    time an individual may change paths in life, from one truth to the other. If they are viewed as complementary
    truths, the conflict between science and faith is mitigated. But Christianity must develop its mythic perception in
    order to remain attractive. The biblical creation story, for instance, could be elaborated, or complemented, to
    better suit the modern intellect. If the Christian truth isn&rsquo;t viewed as the whole truth, but as a
    complementary truth, it is easier to accept that the biblical texts aren&rsquo;t absolutely final. Thus, the spirit
    is released from its captivity in words and letters. Religion and science aren&rsquo;t desperate to win souls,
    because they are no longer enemies of each other. Rather, they are complements. Neither paradigm can achieve total
    dominion, because neither is entirely self-sufficient, for the reason that it must be complemented by the other.
    The question of creation illustrates my point. Did God create everything? I propound that divine creation is a
    complementarian truth. Natural creation is its complementary, and it is equally true. If this notion is accepted,
    the divine and profane paradigms can coexist in peace and harmony. But the notion that God created everything, and
    that natural and Darwinian creation plays no role, is a fundamentalist stance that brings discord.<br>
    <br>
    The biblical creation story is an endless bone of contention. Humanist associations and atheist debaters repudiate
    it as unscientific. But it is relevant in the same sense as the value perspective of the medieval painter, which
    gives people different dimensions depending on importance. According to the subjectivistic moral perspective,
    humanity is much more important than the dinosaurs, and that&rsquo;s why the creation story focuses on mankind.
    From an objectivistic perspective, homo&nbsp;sapiens is a latecomer, a speck in the boundless ocean of time and
    space. Of course, which perspective you are brought up with is highly relevant to the moral development of the
    individual and of society. In certain quarters of life, the scientific paradigm is unable to give us the right
    perspective, and things are given the wrong proportions. What is insignificant from the perspective of the human
    soul is blown out of proportion, whereas what really matters, namely the improvement of the individual soul, is
    deemed insignificant by comparison with material betterment and the maximization of the human population on
    earth.<br>
    <br>
    That&rsquo;s why the scientific paradigm, despite being a success story, is deficient. In the end, it must be
    complemented with a spiritual paradigm that sees things differently. It should be possible for the two paradigms to
    exists side by side, provided that they both give up their ambition of world hegemony. A scientist must realize
    that there is some sense to the mythological creation stories and the spiritual worldview. On the other hand,
    creationists must realize that the scientific version of creation is unshakable scientific truth. It should be
    possible for two complete worldviews to exist side by side, while giving due admission to the alternative
    worldview. They are not competing worldviews anymore, but alternative aspects of reality.<br>
    <br>
    <span class="shead">The loss of inner meaning</span><br>
    <br>
    The scientific paradigm studies nature and its laws as wholly independent of the human soul. Prior to this, people
    thought that calamities would happen if they, in some sense, had kicked over the traces. So, there was a connection
    between the soul and the universe. The autonomy of the material world is central to science. There is no magic
    anymore. That&rsquo;s why science is unfit for matters pertaining to the human soul, as it is only capable of
    relating to the world objectively. The subjective relation is equally important, which means that the spiritual
    paradigm is not obsolete. Science can take us a long way towards an understanding of the world and the human
    condition, but in the end it proves inept. It cannot take into account moral, spiritual, and psychological factors,
    as reality is portrayed without relation to the human soul.<br>
    <br>
    Carl Jung was painfully aware of this problem, and the concomitant loss of wholeness and meaning. That&rsquo;s why
    he tried to restitute the soul&rsquo;s relation to the world. Accordingly, he poured the new wine of psychology
    into old wineskins. Due to synchronistic factors, an aircraft may crash, if one of its noteworthy passengers has
    refrained from living up to the demands of individuation. This was Jung&rsquo;s belief. It is formally similar to
    the old scheme of divine punishment. It&rsquo;s time to abandon this timeworn idea. Complementarity is a
    paradoxical principle invented by Niels&nbsp;Bohr. In the Gifford lectures (Bohr, 1999), he suggested that it be
    used outside the field of quantum physics. In my view, the sacred and the profane ought to be viewed as two
    mutually exclusive worldviews, both of which are largely complete. If it is correct that the human Self is twofold
    and complementarian, then it should be possible to uphold both worldviews. Psychology ought to appropriate profane
    and scientific terms, void of superstition. However, psychology may also be accommodated in a spiritual and
    trinitarian universe, where it always stands in relation to God and the world. Such a complementary relation is
    possible to maintain.<br>
    <br>
    Yet, these worldviews cannot be mixed. The modern individual, having developed an advanced consciousness, cannot
    maintain a conglomerative worldview. It&rsquo;s because he has been deprived of the unitarian naivet&eacute;,
    characteristic of historical mankind. It is natural for the modern person to relate to a scientific worldview. He
    is also capable of taking up a sophisticated trinitarian belief involving contemplation, simplicity, and
    reclusiveness. I know for certain that many intelligent people find this idea attractive, i.e., to go live in
    retreat and lead a simple life for a time. One must make up one&rsquo;s mind, for the time being, whether to live
    in a profane or a spiritual universe. Is this a satisfying solution? In quantum physics, certain theorists have
    expressed the view that complementarity is a provisional solution. They are expecting something better in the
    future. But the complementarity principle seems unshakable.<br>
    <br>
    <span class="shead">Non-overlapping magisteria</span><br>
    <br>
    In my view, science and faith are largely separate and standalone systems, even though they aren&rsquo;t wholly
    self-sufficient. In the end, they can&rsquo;t make do without each other. A complementarity of science and faith is
    coupled with the twofold nature of the human Self (<a href="compself.htm" title=
    "The Complementarian Self">here</a>), which mirrors the <i>hypostatic union</i> of the two nature&rsquo;s of
    Christ. The trinitarian Self is capable of seeing the universe in symbolic and spiritual terms, whereas the
    quaternarian Self interprets reality in profane and material terms. Thus, they interpret the same reality, which
    partly overlap. Stephen&nbsp;Jay&nbsp;Gould&rsquo;s notion of non-overlapping magisteria (<a href=
    "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-overlapping_magisteria" title="Non-overlapping magisteria">here</a>) is similar
    only on the surface. In Gould&rsquo;s system, there is a demarcation line between science, as an explanatory
    system, and faith, which pertains to moral matters. I am not entirely unsympathetic to his views; but the
    complementarian view that I suggest is rooted in the human Self. The trinitarian Self looks at reality with a
    &ldquo;third eye&rdquo;, capable of seeing the spiritual reality that overlays physical reality, a reality in which
    the biblical creation story is true. In a sense, it corresponds to the worldview of Australian aborigines. There is
    a Dream Time in which creation of the world took place, inhabited by the forefather spirits. The aborigines can
    still identify the tracks that the forefather spirits made in the landscape. Aeons ago they already knew about the
    Man of Suffering, that His sign was the cross, and that he dwelled in Heaven. The following is the Australian
    aborigine story named The Southern Cross, abridged by me:</p>
    <blockquote>
      The first humans, two men and a woman, walked the earth. They ate only plants. But one day during a famine, one
      of the men broke the rules of Baiame, the sky king, and killed a kangaroo rat. The woman ate of it, but the other
      man would not eat though he was famished for food. Weak as he was he walked angrily away towards the sunset,
      while the other two still ate hungrily. He continued to walk until he fell down dead under a white gum tree. The
      death spirit Yowi, a black figure with huge fiery eyes, appeared and dropped the man into the hollow centre of
      the tree. Then was heard a terrific burst of thunder and the gum tree lifted from the earth towards the southern
      sky where it planted itself where the Southern Cross is now seen. Two of the shining stars are the eyes of the
      death spirit, and the other two are the eyes of the first man to die. When all nature realized that the passing
      of this man meant that death had come into the world, there was wailing everywhere. So is the first coming of
      death remembered by the tribes, to whom the Southern Cross is a reminder. (cf. Langloh&nbsp;Parker, pp.&#8239;9f)
    </blockquote>
    <p>As I say in my article on the blood sacrifice (<a href="bloodsac.htm" title="The Blood Sacrifice">here</a>):
    &ldquo;The cross is the symbol of the original man who is faithful to God. The Spanish conquistadors were surprised
    to find that it is also the symbol of Quetzalcoatl, the Feathered Serpent. His sacrifice coincides with the
    disobedient act that gave rise to ego emancipation in its pristine form. With disobedience comes death into the
    world. But original man, the god-man, is also the future ideal of psychic economy. He is the once and future king,
    the prototype of a new form of consciousness.&rdquo;<br>
    <br>
    A person who has a sensitive consciousness, as he is living according to the trinitarian Self, can see the truth in
    the above story of creation. In it, he can also see the truth of Christ. Although a scientific and mundane
    consciousness is incapable of perceiving such things, it doesn&rsquo;t mean that the profane view is evil. The
    profane worldview only becomes evil when it attempts to oust the trinitarian perspective in order to achieve
    dominion. After all, science is not capable of explaining all creation. In the end, scientists will find that the
    last piece is missing, and that it cannot be found. The trinitarian paradigm has the missing piece in the jigsaw
    puzzle. The same would be true of the trinitarian perspective. A complete worldview cannot be achieved as long as
    the last missing piece isn&rsquo;t provided by the quaternarian paradigm. This is complementarity in terms of
    Niels&nbsp;Bohr.<br>
