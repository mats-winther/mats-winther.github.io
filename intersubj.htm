<H1>Critique of Intersubjectivity</H1>
<P><br><br><SPAN class="shead">Abstract</SPAN><br><br>
The article investigates the philosophical/psychological notion of
<I>intersubjectivity</I> and argues that our subjective involvement in each
other, especially the psychoanalytic relation between analyst and analysand,
ought to be regarded as an involvement <I>on the unconscious level</I>. The
diverse notions of a joint conscious creation, or joint narrative, implying a
relative merger of our conscious personalities, are harmful and will not invoke
a wholesome form of subjective engagement.<br><br>

third, narrative.<BR>

What is the uniquely psychological contribution to the philosophical concept
of intersubjectivity 
(<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersubjectivity"  title="Intersubjectivity">here</A>)?
The answer is <I>unconscious</I> intersubjectivity. The idea of a conscious
interaction between people (such as a joint narrative, 
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrative"  title="Narrative">here</A>)
is meaningless without the notion of an unconscious interaction, just like the
idea of a conscious mind is meaningless without a notion of the unconscious.
Psychologists know that we are only skimming the surface when observing the
contents of consciousness. Below this layer are the unconscious motivations.
Hence, if we are going to talk about an intersubjective realm on the conscious
level, then it&rsquo;s necessary to give consideration to the unconscious realm,
which, especially in the psychoanalytic setting, is much more relevant.
</P>
<P>Thomas H. Ogden, discusses his notion of an &lsquo;analytic third&rsquo; and
explains that</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I view the intersubjective analytic third as an ever-changing
unconscious third subject (more verb than noun) which powerfully contributes to
the structure of the analytic relationship. [T]he analytic third is at first
almost entirely an unconscious phenomenon. Since the unconscious, by definition,
cannot be invaded on the wings of the brute force of will, the analyst and
analysand must use indirect (associational) methods to &ldquo;catch the drift&rdquo;
(Freud, 1923/1955, p.115) of the unconscious co-creation (Ogden, 1999).</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Regardless how clever philosophical definitions we make of the notion of
intersubjectivity, it will always remain &lsquo;unconscious co-creation&rsquo; or
&lsquo;unconscious rapport&rsquo;. Philosophically inclined people tend to view
intersubjectivity as &lsquo;conscious co-creation&rsquo;, on lines of  philosopher Hannah&nbsp;Arendt, et al. But consciousness cannot be unleashed and be allowed to
run far ahead of the unconscious. Such a standpoint will merely result in
bloodless conscious products, and the joint narrative will become a watery soup
with no healing qualities.
</P>
<P><SPAN class="shead">Self-disclosure</SPAN><br><br>
Most psychological authors (unlike their philosophical counterparts) realize
that we always have to go along with the unconscious. However, some of them
argue that self-disclosure on part of the analyst, i.e. disclosure of his own
unconscious motives (corresponding to the analytic disclosure of the unconscious
motives of the patient), will facilitate intersubjective exchange. But if
intersubjectivity is viewed as a form of unconscious rapport then this proposal
seems self-contradictory. Such a brute force approach is likely to obstruct the
&lsquo;analytic third&rsquo;. 
</P>
<P>A good example is the way of synchronization of bodily postures, which is an
everyday form of unconscious communication. If the analyst becomes aware of the
phenomenon it will immediately cease to work for him. Hence, if  he continually
makes his awareness of the bodily postures available to the patient it would
immediately put a curb on unconscious bodily signalling.
</P>
<P>By analogy, if the analyst would wholly reveal his subjective motives to the
patient, this is likely to decrease intersubjective exchange, and not facilitate
it. Bringing the hidden facts to light would obstruct unconscious co-ordination.
Besides, it&rsquo;s not always advisable to expose a fragile patient to extraneous
psychological contents as it could worsen his/her condition. Ogden (1995), quite
logically, advises against overt self-disclosure of the analyst&rsquo;s experience
within the &lsquo;analytic third&rsquo;. 
</P>
<P>The analyst&rsquo;s disclosure of countertransference experience might easily
disrupt an autonomous unconscious factor. As the relation is partly conscious
and partly unconscious, the analyst would better maintain a proper mixture of
conscious analysis and unconscious intersubjectivity. This, of course, is
modulated by the patient&rsquo;s personality. Sometimes, it seems, a patient needs to
be &ldquo;mothered&rdquo;: the obstacle can only be overcome by slow growth in the
fertile environment of intersubjectivity. On the other hand, at some stage a patient could fare
with an immediate realization of unconscious motives.
</P>
<P><SPAN class="shead">Otherness</SPAN><br><br>
The co-creation of relationship builds on the fact that at the kernel of the
relation is the self-consciousness of the respective partners. A differentiated
self-consciousness is a requirement for the awareness of &lsquo;inner otherness&rsquo; and
&lsquo;outer otherness&rsquo;. This realization will allow for a co-creative &lsquo;other&rsquo; that
encompasses the relationship. Such a phenomenon can evolve favourably only if
one acknowledges its autonomy, its otherness.  It must be left alone; that is,
the ego mustn&rsquo;t identify with the co-creative whole. The analyst ought not to
think that he is consciously creating an &lsquo;intersubjective realm&rsquo; together with
the analysand. It&rsquo;s not a product of the conscious ego. Here is where theorists
of intersubjectivity generally go wrong, probably because they lean too much on
phenomenological philosophy, which lacks a notion of unconscious autonomy.
Ogden, however, has come to deviate from the general discourse in that he speaks
of the unconscious &lsquo;analytic third&rsquo; as a factor of relative autonomy; a &ldquo;third
subject&rdquo;, created in the unconscious interplay of analyst and analysand.
</P> 
<P>To give priority to an individual self-consciousness also means to truly
accept an &lsquo;autonomous other&rsquo;. These things go together. Yet, as Frie
(1999) explains, most theorists of intersubjectivity fail to appreciate
the importance of individual self-consciousness. When intersubjectivist theory
neglects the differentiation of ego consciousness the whole idea of the
analyst&rsquo;s subjective involvement is corrupted. It gives rise to
intersubjectivist &lsquo;merger theories&rsquo;, such as Winnicott&rsquo;s (1999) notion of an
<I>intermediate playground</I> where subjectivity merges with objective
reality. Instead of defining itself in relation to an inner and outer otherness
and acquiring a modest dimension, the ego swells out beyond its borders in an
attempt to engulf the other party. An ego that cannot tolerate otherness is
bound to identify with the unconscious co-creative whole, thereby divesting it
of its autonomy. This controlling behaviour is typical of a narcissistic <I>modus
operandi</I> and it is clearly harmful to the patient.
</P>
<P><SPAN class="shead">Unconscious togetherness</SPAN><br><br>
An unconscious &lsquo;otherness&rsquo; mustn&rsquo;t be viewed as an &ldquo;alternative ego&rdquo;.
It is something qualitatively different than ego consciousness. By referring to
the unconscious as &lsquo;other&rsquo; I try to highlight its relative autonomy, i.e., that
it is beyond our control and that it can, by itself, change over time. One can
compare it with a domestic animal, like a cat (a very common personification of
the unconscious in dreams, etc.). It is not really another &lsquo;person&rsquo; because it
lacks a fixed ego consciousness.  Still, in a sense, it is an &lsquo;other&rsquo;, a
relatively self-willed being that now and then detaches itself and goes its own
way. 
</P>
<P>But since the pioneering times of Freud and Jung, the unconscious has lost
much of its &ldquo;catlike&rdquo; nature. The concept, as used by later theorists,
seems more technical. It is often viewed as merely a repository of memories of
childhood relations. It&rsquo;s more passive in appearance. It&rsquo;s like theorists would
not allow it autonomy. The notion of an unconscious intersubjectivity might help
to repair this.
</P>
<P>What is the real reason why people get together, light candles, and do small
talk while eating dinner, etc? And why have religious congregations always
assembled to bow down, in togetherness, before invisible beings as, for
instance, the cat goddess Bastet? In spiritualist seances, too, they await, in
togetherness, the appearance of the &lsquo;other&rsquo;. 
</P>
<P>When we get together, provided that we damp the assertiveness of our own
egos, it seems like we have a good chance of becoming aware of the unconscious
as an autonomous &lsquo;other&rsquo;, almost as a &lsquo;cat goddess&rsquo;.  It&rsquo;s not easy to have a
&lsquo;seance&rsquo; on your own; it&rsquo;s frightful, and the defences of our consciousness are
alert. But, when another person is in the room, the defences slacken. We are not
merely aware of our own ego, but (provided that we have some social talent) we
are, so to speak, prepared to let the other person in. 
</P>
<P>True social talent is to let other people in, to let them have a say, to
learn to appreciate them for who they really are. This means that we have to
have a good self-knowledge, a differentiated self-consciousness. An ego that is
not differentiated from the unconscious has not acquired that &lsquo;modest dimension&rsquo;
which enables it to bow down in togetherness, in order to allow entrance to the
&lsquo;cat goddess&rsquo;. 
</P>
<P>By example, suppose that the analyst would inform the analysand of his
sexual transference to the analysand. This means that his ego asserts itself and
goes beyond its borders. This foolish ego has not realized that these sexual
feelings are not at all &lsquo;his&rsquo;. The mystery of sexuality, so to speak, really
belongs to the &lsquo;cat goddess&rsquo;. Thus, on account of the subject&rsquo;s identification
with the unconscious, this autonomous &lsquo;cat goddess&rsquo; could not appear as a &lsquo;third
subject&rsquo; in the relation. It is choked, and with it is lost the healing
influences of an &ldquo;unconscious togetherness&rdquo;.
</P>
<P><SPAN class="shead">False intersubjectivity</SPAN><br><br>
Such things happen now and then, and maybe of the good, too. However,
viewing self-disclosure of the analyst as an ideal would be to give preference
to the analyst&rsquo;s ego, which will become inflated with unconscious content, and
thereby it will acquire this very stuck-up assertiveness that hinders true
contact with the analysand. He won&rsquo;t let the other person in. He is merely
relating to his own projections.
</P>
<P>So, in my view, this is the false form of intersubjectivity, proposed by the
&lsquo;merger theories&rsquo;. Although well-meaning, these theories really advocate a
merger of the analyst&rsquo;s ego with the analysand, a flagrantly narcissistic
preoccupation. The problem is that as soon as the analyst has identified with an
unconscious content and disclosed it to the analysand, a contradictory content
will begin to constellate in the unconscious, since the unconscious contains all
opposites. So his &lsquo;amorous feelings&rsquo; might later, for instance, turn into
sadistic fantasies, a phenomenon which accounts for the ambivalency of the
narcissistic personality.
</P>
<P>Yet I am not of the opinion that &ldquo;unconscious togetherness&rdquo; is
always the solution. For instance, an analyst can initially be assertive in the
sense that he &lsquo;lectures&rsquo; the analysand on psychological notions in order to
strengthen his consciousness, that is, to achieve a separation from the
unconscious on part of the analysand. Intersubjectivity is clearly not an easy
subject.
</P>
<P><SPAN class="shead">Prereflective communication</SPAN><br><br>
Truth is that the analyst needn&rsquo;t really bother about &ldquo;disclosure of
the countertransference&rdquo; because he will give himself away, regardless
(unless he is a stone-cold &ldquo;dead mother&rdquo;). The patient can register
the choice of words, tone of voice, facial expression, and other expressive
motions, like involuntary bodily motions. Nor does the girl have to say to the
boy that she is &ldquo;having a crush&rdquo; on him. A more powerful statement is
to blush.
</P>
<P>If we communicate certain things unconsciously like this, rather than going
via ego consciousness and verbalization, then we circumvent that notorious
&lsquo;synthetic function&rsquo; of the ego. Any unconscious content that treads into the
limelight of the ego is immediately gobbled up by the ego. The ego regards it as
part of itself. Sometimes the content really belongs to the ego, but more often
it belongs to the &lsquo;intersubjective unconscious&rsquo;. (Actually, Thomas&nbsp;Ogden
is much into prereflective communication and the bodily aspects of the analytic
work.)
</P>
<P>The analyst will, at a later stage, be able to verbalize his experience
within the &lsquo;intersubjective unconscious&rsquo; and, yet, be determined to keep the
content at arm&rsquo;s length. He can do this by being cautious and not trying to
catch hold of the content at once, but by grasping it tentatively, not nailing
it to the wall. This is actually possible for certain sophisticated analysts who
have acquired a true modesty of the ego. And, of course, the patient must be at
such an advanced stage that he can avoid projecting it on the analyst.
</P>
<P>So that teenage boy knows that the &lsquo;message of love&rsquo; is genuine because it
doesn&rsquo;t reach him via the girl&rsquo;s ego and speech organ. Had it been so, then he
could suspect that she is not a modest person and that her interest is mostly
due to the fact that he is a rich kid and drives an expensive car, or whatever. So
he understands that Cupid has shot an arrow in her heart. And since the girl is
equipped with a modest ego that refrains from identifying with the power of
love, then the &lsquo;love goddess&rsquo; can continue to exist in the &lsquo;intersubjective
unconscious&rsquo; which is uniting them both. 
</P>
<P>Needless to say, the &lsquo;intersubjective unconscious&rsquo; does not remain totally
unconscious. Conscious and unconscious are relative terms. Most green plants
that we buy come with a tag: <I>Do not place in direct sunlight!</I> Many
unconscious contents, as it were, come with such a tag, too. The direct sunlight
of the ego should be avoided. The moonlit realm of the &lsquo;intersubjective
unconscious&rsquo; is a much better place for them to inhabit.
</P>
<P>Obviously, we humans already have a natural understanding of such issues.
That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s so advantageous not to go via &lsquo;verbal disclosure&rsquo; but, instead,
go via the unconscious. Ego inflation is avoided, and whatever the content is,
the patient will not feel pressured as he knows that it&rsquo;s not deliberate, and
the &lsquo;cat goddess&rsquo; is allowed to live on without being gobbled up by the ego.
</P>
<P><SPAN class="shead">Conclusion</SPAN><br><br>
I contend that there are two kinds of intersubjectivity: (1)&nbsp;the unsound
&lsquo;merger theories&rsquo; and (2)&nbsp;the sound version where the &lsquo;intersubjective
co-creation&rsquo; takes place autonomously in the unconscious, supported by an ego
that allows for autonomy by defining itself against both &lsquo;inner otherness&rsquo; and
&lsquo;outer otherness&rsquo;. It implies that the unconscious is acknowledged as a
comparably autonomous &lsquo;inner other&rsquo;, rather than a passive storage space for
repressions or introjected object-relations.
</P>
<P>The realm of unconscious co-creation can be viewed as a greenhouse, which
must be carefully maintained over a long time. If a seed is buried in the earth
then we have to leave it there. One can&rsquo;t simply tear it up, lay it on the
table, saying, &ldquo;this is what I find in the unconscious&rdquo;. This will
only destroy the burgeoning plant. Instead one must water it modestly. When it
begins to sprout, it should be exposed to a little sunlight (=&nbsp;conscious
recognition), but not too much.
