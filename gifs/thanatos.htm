        <I>Abstract</I>: The principle of the death drive (Thanatos) is understood as a genuine psychic force connected with the mother complex. Destructivity in repetitious form temporarily emancipates the ego from unconscious dependency in the psychology of phallic-narcissism. It is also present in the immature or fragile personality (the weak ego). Thanatos is unconsciously therapeutic 
in that it aims at strengthening a weak ego consciousness, thus to ward off unconscious wholeness, invariably associated with the Mother archetype. Although it serves to avoid regression, destructiveness can become obsessive. The sun-god Horus&#39;s perennial struggle against Seth, in Egyptian mythology, illustrates the dynamics of Thanatos. Accordingly, every night Seth defends the sun bark by defeating the negative Mother in the guise of the chaos monster Apophis. Thanks to Seth, the sun of consciousness is restored and can rise again in the morning. In history, phallocentric culture is sustained by Thanatos in its restorative capacity, but this runs counter to the ideals of patriarchal culture, whose guiding star is Horus.

      <B>Introduction</B>
      <BR>
      <BR>
      At the outbreak of the First World War young men happily marched to the front, apparently elated at the prospect of enormous mass-killings and their own self-annihilation. War historians still scratch their heads and wonder what that war was all about. Today, we observe a chocking indifference concerning the prospects of society and our civilization, in the face of mass-immigration and the impact of consumerism on the environment, including the ongoing mass-extinction of species, which occurs at a rate 1000 times the normal, a rate which increases rapidly. It could be argued that our modern culture is unconsciously obsessed with Thanatos, an unconscious wish to self-destruct.
      <BR>
      <BR>
      In psychoanalysis, theorists have time and again introduced a principle, ad hoc, which strives after destruction. <SPAN CLASS="nobr">Sigmund Freud</SPAN> used the term &#39;Todestrieb&#39; (death drive), while later theorists also use the denominations Thanatos, mortido, and destrudo. It is very curious while we would tend to think that warfare, neurosis and marital manhandling, are all secondary multifactorial phenomena, depending on many premises. We would tend to see these as &quot;serious mistakes&quot; and illnesses that must be remedied. But certain psychoanalytic thinkers have argued that it is a vital force in itself, which will always abide and must also be lived through, I suppose. Psychoanalyst <SPAN CLASS="nobr">Poul Bjerre</SPAN> (1876-1964) argued that the circular movement of death and renewal is an essential factor in human life<B>[<A HREF="#Bjerre">1</A>]</B>. Is there something tangible in Bjerre&#39;s thoughts about death and renewal, or is this a form of Nietzschean philosophy?
      <BR>
      <BR>
      It&#39;s high time to investigate this curious notion, to make it straight. Is it a blind alley in psychoanalytic history or do these thinkers point at something very significant? Is human life really a circular series of death and renewals? I suppose the psychoanalytic notion of a death drive has its antecedents in the romantic philosophers. Schopenhauer, who draws on Buddhist philosophy, said that one must bring the endless cycle of death and rebirth to an end through an attitude of resignation. The rebirth cycle results from the universal Will, which is behind all creation. <SPAN CLASS="nobr">Friedrich Nietzsche</SPAN> said that the struggle of warfare was to be sought after because it paved the way for the &Uuml;bermensch. Freud wasn't the first to introduce the notion in psychoanalysis. In "Civilization and Its Discontents", ch. 6, he testifies to his own disapproval when it first appeared in psychoanalytic literature. So he affirms that the concept originated elsewhere.
      <BR>
      <BR>
      <B>Thanatos</B>
      <BR>
      <BR>
      Freud didn&#39;t view it as an instinct. He called it &#39;Trieb&#39; (drive), which is not essential to the life of an organism. &#39;Archetype&#39; is really a better notion. <SPAN CLASS="nobr">Erich Neumann</SPAN> discusses &quot;the strugglers&quot;<B>[<A HREF="#Neumann">2</A>]</B>. These are mythological figures who are depicted as having a strong emancipative drive owing to a strong motherly bond. But in breaking free they inevitably fall into the clutches of the Mother of Death, and hence they return to their beginnings. Mother wins anyway, as it were. My argument is that the principle of the death drive is connected with the mother complex. Thanatos derives its energy from the mother complex, that is, an unconscious archetype lends its energy from a weightier one. A suicide bomber blows himself away, because there is something in him that wants to overcome the Mother, which symbolically denotes his unconscious lifestyle and strong attachment to the material.
      <BR>
      <BR>
      The civilizational catastrophes repeatedly incurred on Western civilization could be explained in this way. For instance, what lies behind the EU/EMU project is really the Great Mother, and in breaking free from her demands, politicians and economists unconsciously trip the system up. Accordingly, EU has been described as a &quot;suicide pact&quot;. The backdrop of the WWI and WWII was &#39;the Reich&#39; and &#39;Mater Germanica&#39;. Two decades ago, Sweden came close to financial ruin. <SPAN CLASS="nobr">Olof Palme,</SPAN> whose politics had striven to create &#39;Folkhemmet&#39; (the Mother State, lit. &quot;People&#39;s Home&quot;, otherwise known as the Nanny State), had restructured society in such a way that the economical consequences were soon to become abysmal. This was, in fact, a collective suicide attempt. We see the same phenomenon in the so called suicide sects; <SPAN CLASS="nobr">Jim Jones</SPAN> and the Peoples&#39; Temple, <SPAN CLASS="nobr">David Koresh</SPAN> and the Branch Davidians, <SPAN CLASS="nobr">Marshall Herff Applewhite</SPAN> and the Heaven&#39;s Gate, <SPAN CLASS="nobr">Joseph Di Mambro</SPAN> and the Order of The Solar Temple, etc. These begin as Mother cults, i.e. they are kindergartens for adults, where people regress to infantile psychological dependency. Enters the archetype of Thanatos. The death drive culls energy from the powerful Mother archetype, with disastrous consequences.
      <BR>
      <BR>
      The lesson seems to <SPAN CLASS="nobr">be -</SPAN> beware of the Great Mother! The positive Mother, the cornucopia of fortune, will inevitably turn into the negative Mother. This occurs because we, being adult modern people, aren&#39;t designed to lead an unconscious life of psychological dependency. Unlike primitives and children, there is in us a strong impetus to individuate. We mustn&#39;t put ourselves at the mercy of people who are possessed by the Mother archetype in whatever form. So we better watch out for the <SPAN CLASS="nobr">Marshall Herff Applewhites</SPAN> of politics. Thanatos only surfaces in the individual who psychologically remains in unconscious dependency. I hold that the narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) is predicated on the same archetype, namely Thanatos.
      <BR>
      <BR>
      Destrudo, as it is also called, is connected with the well-known mythologem of the &quot;phallic Mother&quot;. Those men, whom I mentioned, who are representatives of the Mother and whose unconscious agenda is destruction, are unconsciously identified with the phallus of the Mother. The phallic Mother is discussed by Freud in &quot;New Introductory Lectures on Psycho-Analysis&quot;, etc.<B>[<A HREF="#Mother">3</A>]</B>. A typical example in fairytales is the witch who has a long finger, toe, or nose. In mythology, the Mother deity is always surrounded by little male chthonic deities (the Cabeiri, etc.). They are mere 
outgrowths on the Mother, representing a male principle incapable of properly
breaking free. In this dwarfish form, I think they symbolize libido in the form of mere amusements, incapable of overcoming unconscious gravity through a thorough commitment to a cause or an idea, which would take root as continuous ego function and conscious  directionality. <BR><BR>Historically, this has its counterpart in matriarchal society when male
identity was moulded on the Mother's phallus and was little more
than a maternal phallic outgrowth, remaining slave to the unconscious, as it were. We can observe in mythology when the phallic deity grows out of its dwarfish form, giving rise to phallic-narcissistic (or phallocentric, patricentric) culture, which is furtively matriarchal. In comparative religion the phallic deity goes under the name of Seth, Satan, Tezcatlipoca, Wotan, and (the fundamentalist version of) Jahve and Allah. In Egyptian mythology the battle goes on between Seth as representing the Mother&#39;s phallus, and Horus the sun-god, who represents the patriarchal paradigm proper. Horus is finally victorious.
      <BR>
      <BR>
      Seth is a fabulous creature with a very long curved snout, phallic in significance. But he represents the dark and devilish form of male energy, as he is merely an outgrowth on the Mother. In personal psychology, we can observe exactly the same phenomenon today. The average Greater Middle East dweller lacks an anima<B>[<A HREF="#Anima">4</A>]</B> proper, while his only ideal is the mother. His psychic economy is typically of the phallic-narcissistic kind. Such a civilization, it seems, is caught between the matriarchal and patriarchal stages.
      <BR>
      <BR>
      Phallic-narcissistic cultures have a sectarian view of social life. People belong to clans and families that are organized according to the matriarchal ideal, i.e. the clan or family is viewed as one body. It is viewed as the Mother of the individual whose protection he/she receives throughout life, but which also demands total loyalty. The family is all-encompassing, especially to the female members. It represents the Mother who always provides and protects. The father of the family personifies the motherly phallus, which vouches for his pronounced narcissism. He always tries to imitate an erect penis, also when he is out for a walk.
      <BR>
      <BR>
      So the clan and the family of phallocentric culture is formally the same phenomenon as the suicide sects. That&#39;s why family members, who are suspected of disloyalty, are murdered (in so called honour-killings). Destruction is always close when the mother-phallus is activated. The phallic-narcissistic male experiences the slightest emancipative tendency as an act of disloyalty and disobedience. In the religion of the Old Testament the phallic deity demands total obedience and loyalty. The religion focuses on zeal. Transgressions are punished with mass-murder.
      <BR>
      <BR>
      In a suicide-bombing, or in a school/workplace-shooting, the phallic-narcissistic male (who is identified with the Mother-phallus) destroys the transgressors, but he also destroys himself. This is the utmost consequence of the death drive. The destructive drive is predicated on the weak ego. In order to avoid regression to infantilism and unconsciousness he sacrifices a limb to the Mother goddess of the unconscious. The limb could be a family member, or it could be himself, or a limb of his own. To sacrifice a finger or a tooth (e.g.) in order to prove loyalty to the clan, is a common motif. It is also a standard initiatory rite in primitive religion, to expose oneself to torture, laceration, or mutilation in some form.
      <BR>
      <BR>
      <B>Destructivity is unconsciously therapeutic</B>
      <BR>
      <BR>
      I have argued in my article on the blood sacrifice<B>[<A HREF="#Blood">5</A>]</B> that this motif aims at strengthening the weak consciousness, thus to ward off unconscious wholeness in its symbolic form of Mother goddess. Interestingly, Apotemnophilia is a strong desire for the amputation of a healthy limb<B>[<A HREF="#Apo">6</A>]</B>. There are men who amputate a healthy leg, and afterwards feel a great relief. Tezcatlipoca, the one-legged Aztec god who represents the Mother-phallus, likewise sacrificed his leg in the jaws of the chaos monster (the negative Mother). Symbolically, this portrays a damaged god connected with darkness and sin. By losing a limb, thus losing his wholeness, he has broken free of unconscious wholeness and defeated the negative Mother goddess.
      <BR>
      <BR>
      To incur physical damage, or to downgrade oneself morally, e.g., by committing crimes, or being generally nasty, thus fulfils a defensive function. By example, <SPAN CLASS="nobr">Michael Jackson</SPAN> illustrated this theme when he dressed up in black leather and sang &quot;<I>I&#39;m bad, I&#39;m bad!</I>&quot;. By compensatory measure, he expresses that he is not a mama&#39;s boy. The student that Jackson impersonates is killed in the story, but this is not included in the video. Young girls debase themselves sexually, cut themselves, pierce themselves with tongue-trinkets, etc., and put ugly tattoos on their skin. The phallic consciousness compensates the mother complex with destructive acts that aim to damage wholeness. It is a motivating factor behind burning suburbs in Western Europe, and it obtains as an undercurrent of terrorism and warfare. From a mythological perspective, the deity that governs this destructive process is Tezcatlipoca,  or Seth, as a personification of Thanatos.
      <BR>
      <BR>
      <B>Trauma therapy</B>
      <BR>
      <BR>
      Freud focused on the repetitive self-destructive tendencies, especially in those patients with a traumatic history. My argument is that self-laceration, e.g., in the form of girls cutting themselves, has a temporary therapeutic effect and revitalizes consciousness, as it wards off childhood unconscious wholeness (i.e., none other than the Mother archetype), which is always proximate to the immature ego, and also the ego damaged by trauma. In the case of narcissistic individuals, psychoanalysts have always regarded them as immature.<BR><BR>
      This self-destructive tendency must be repeated or it must be definitive (i.e. suicidal). Traumatized American soldiers often resort to self-destructive behaviour or commit suicide after having returned home. It has grown into a huge problem. On account of their self-image of manliness, a regress to childhood motherly dependency is out of the question. These are generally tough men that have been brought up on the role model of the crew cut, self-assured, American man, who can always fend for himself and refuses to be a burden to anybody else. Thus, the traumatized ego cannot sink back into motherly unconsciousness and dependency, but must ward it off by repeated self-laceration in some form. Eventually, they often take the step of the &quot;strugglers&quot; in myth, i.e., in an attempt to escape the Mother they kill themselves, and thus fall into the embrace of the Death-Mother.
      <BR>
      <BR>
      However, we know that the paragon of manliness, the mythological Heracles (Hercules) donned women&#39;s clothes and did service to the Mother goddess for a year, during which time he was compelled to silence and is supposed to have taken up weaving<B>[<A HREF="#Ovid">7</A>]</B>. Knit work, crochet work, and weaving, are similar to a spider's work. Although, the spider is a negative mother symbol, <span class="nobr">von Franz</span> says that such work generally has a very salutary effect, especially on women. Symbolically, it often means the spinning of fantasies, as a way of preparing for the future<B>[<A HREF="#weaving">8</A>]</B>. I suggest that this is indicative of an ancient form of therapy for traumatized soldiers. They were persuaded to slough off manliness, and go and live in the lush garden of the Mother, free of all cares, spinning fantasies for the future. Obviously, for the traumatized soldier, a therapy of strengthening consciousness to reinforce the ego, is already too late. In order to put an end to the repetition of the distressing experience, which, according to my argument, constitutes a defense against regression, the patient ought to follow the example of Heracles, and allow himself to regress into boyhood, there to fall into the arms of the Mother. This is effectively a breach of the incest-barrier, which explains the averseness that it invokes in the male.
      <BR>
      <BR>
      Arguably, this is how trauma should be treated in the general case, also when it comes to self-cutting girls. The patient should be convinced to abandon responsibilities and cares, and to take up "weaving", in some form. The defense involving destructivity will abate, as there is no longer an incest-barrier to defend against. So it is not the question of making conscious the causes of trauma, because this is, in itself, a form of self-laceration that constitutes a defense. In fact, the solution is the opposite, namely to consign all problems to oblivion. The process involves the restitution of the ego in the fountain of life, which is the unconscious.
      <BR>
      <BR>
      <B>The rivalry of Horus and Seth</B>
      <BR>
      <BR>
      The epic conflict between Horus and Seth corresponds to the conflict of Quetzalcoatl (Kukulcan) and Tezcatlipoca, the one-legged phallic god in Mezoamerican mythology. Whereas Horus is a sun-god who has the form of a falcon, Quetzalcoatl is the &quot;winged serpent&quot;, which is the dragon, i.e. a creature which is wholly earthly but also wholly spiritual. So Quetzalcoatl was a god-man, like <SPAN CLASS="nobr">Jesus Christ.</SPAN> Quetzalcoatl was prophesied to return and put and end to the cruel reign of Tezcatlipoca. Interestingly, the Christian religion also arrived in Mexico at the anticipated date, when Cortez went ashore. Horus, likewise, was a man-god. On earth, the pharaoh is Horus. The difference between Horus and Seth corresponds to the paradigmatic difference between <SPAN CLASS="nobr">Jesus Christ</SPAN> and Jahve. Jahve stands for phallocentrism. He is essentially the same deity as Set, Tezcatlipoca, and Allah.
      <BR>
      <BR>
      The conflict represented by these mythologies goes on to this day. Phallocentrism stands against a modern patriarchal consciousness. Today, orthodox Judaism and Islam are often denoted as patriarchal. In my view, this is incorrect terminology. A better term would be patricentric, paternalistic, or phallocentric. The autocracy of the phallocentric male depends on compensation. He suffers from a mother-fixation which he always tries to compensate. Instead of dealing with the &quot;dirt&quot; of the unconscious (the dark Mother), he focuses on rules for cleanliness. His mother-dependency betrays that his culture is patricentric as it overcompensates a furtive dependency on the mother (in its wide meaning as unconscious dependency). So it is not properly patriarchal, while there is still a strong attachment to the motherly principle.
      <BR>
      <BR>
      Western Christian culture, on the other hand, is inherently patriarchal since it builds on spiritual values and focuses on the abstract and conceptual. It is important to remember that these are archetypes at work in the collective psyche of humanity. They do not represent a conflict between civilizations. However, if we remain unconscious of them, the risk is great that the archetypal strife, through identification, is misunderstood in an overly concrete way. Rivaling psychic economies in individual psychology are projected as conflicting civilizations. The guiding star for the Western civilization is patriarchal consciousness. However, both phallocentrism and the matriarchal worldview are today making an inroad in Western culture<B>[<A HREF="#Intrusion">9</A>]</B>. So this is not the least a conflict internal to civilization and internal to personality.
      <BR>
      <BR>
      These gods do not denote human personality types. They are forces of unconscious nature that will always continue to exist. Seth, representing the dark forces, castrated Osiris whose phallus could never be recovered. Whereas Horus is the living pharaoh, Osiris is the dead pharaoh, who abides in the spiritual realm. This double-nature corresponds to <SPAN CLASS="nobr">Jesus Christ</SPAN> who is true God and true man. The phallus of the Mother is the male active principle of the ambivalent force of nature, which is the Mother of Life and Death. To me, it is evident that Western culture centers on the Christian archetype which is Christ or Horus, whereas the Aztec, orthodox Islamic, and the orthodox Judaic culture, center on the phallus of the Mother, which is Jahve, Allah, etc. <BR><BR>The archetype that dominates a civilization is formative of its culture and therefore of personality. The phallic-narcissistic man has no notion of true womanliness (as he lacks an anima<B>[<A HREF="#Anima">4</A>]</B>), thus the mother remains the ideal. If a woman cannot live up to motherliness, she must be a whore, which is why women tend to be beaten. This notion permeates the phallocentric cultures, which also include certain Middle East Christian cultures. 
      When I went to school we never demoted the girls as &quot;whores&quot;. Today, it is very common. It is the legacy of immigrant cultures, primarily from the Middle East and North Africa. Many have argued that Muslims, especially, are unintegrable in Western society. However, there are signs that Western society is today changing its guiding-star, from Horus to Set, from democracy to phallocentrism and matriarchy, partly due to the influence of immigration. Arguably, the European Union could be understood as both the Mother of all European people, and the Great Phallus, i.e., a world power. The archetype that rules such institutions is Seth, which is why everything revolves around money and legislation, whereas there is a chocking unawareness of the moral incentives of both society and personality.
      <BR>
      <BR>
      There is mythological parallelism also in case of Seth and the Aztec war god Tezcatlipoca. Tezcatlipoca defeated the Earth Monster, Cipactli. That was how he lost his leg. This feat was necessary for the world to come into existence. Ursa Major is his foot print in the starry sky. It always revolves around the polar star as he, being the evil god, is not allowed to enter through the gate of the polar star into the highest heaven. Analogously, Seth, equipped with a spear, defeats the serpent Apophis, which threatens the sun bark every night during its journey through the Underworld. In these myths the dark god is still an ambivalent force, bringing both good and evil consequences, which is what <SPAN CLASS="nobr">William James</SPAN> refers to in his well-known saying: &quot;<I>The world is all the richer for having a devil in it, so long as we keep our foot upon his neck.</I>&quot;
      <BR>
      <BR>
      Seth was worshipped as a great god in Egypt, corresponding to the worship of Tezcatlipoca/Huitzilopochtli in Mexico. However, after the close of the New Kingdom in Egypt, he was ousted from the Egyptian pantheon. Earlier rituals had enacted the slaying of the evil force in the form of the serpent Apophis. However, now the serpent-slayer himself carried the role of the evil force, whose defeat by the hands of Horus was celebrated in ritual<B>[<A HREF="#Seth">10</A>]</B>. This is a very interesting change. It reflects upon the implacable standpoint of the Christians, whose view of the devil was utterly dark. However, this is compensated in European fairytales, where the actions of the devil sometimes has good consequences.
      <BR>
      <BR>
      The adolescent age is connected with the term phallic-narcissism, hence the cockiness of the male. However, in certain ethnicities, this attitude still prevails in adulthood. Pre-adolescent age is characterized by attachment to the mother in its wide meaning as dependency, material attachments, concrete thinking, and an unreflecting lifestyle, to boot. Many African people still remain at this psychological level, under the rule of the collective mother complex, which is the matriarchal goddess. But when the phallus begins to &quot;grow out&quot; of the Mother, it signifies a relative disengagement from the motherly principle. In the Egyptian pantheon, Seth personifies the Mother-phallus, and is therefore the god of phallic-narcissistic (phallocentric, paternalistic) culture. Horus, his arch-fiend, being the fatherly sun-god, is the god of patriarchal culture, i.e., the god of adulthood proper (as is the Christ). Evidently, these stages, the matriarchal, the phallocentric, and the patriarchal, are connected with different levels of IQ. Western Christian culture is inherently patriarchal since it builds on spiritual values and focuses on the abstract and conceptual. IQ is predicated on level of proficiency in the abstract realm. It is significant that it obtains as the backyard of Western culture.
  <BR>
      <BR>
      <B>The biological perspective</B>
	  <BR><BR>
	  The difficulty that Freud wrestled with was how to biologically motivate an innate tendency  that goes against life. Eros sustains life while Thanatos is antagonistic to Eros. Yet, Thanatos is not antagonistic to life from an overarching perspective. The point is that both Eros and Thanatos work to sustain life. It functions like a thermostat. When it gets too hot, electricity is shut off temporarily. Seth is a menace. He is the god of the dead region, the desert. But he defends the sun bark in the  dead of night. In modern biology, such dialectics has been verified. All living beings undergo programmed cell death without which they could not develop to maturity. Destructive agents in the form of free radicals (oxidants) cause damage to living cells. So people eat antioxidants to remove these destructive compounds. However, over-consumption of antioxidants, especially with elderly people, is destructive to the body, causing inflammation and accelerated aging. <BR><BR>The reason is that free radicals are needed in the immune system. White blood cells are responsible for the defense against virus, bacteria, toxins, and cancer. They utilize free radicals as "missiles", shooting them at the infectants, thus to destroy them. This means that a shortage of free radicals in the body weakens the defense. The white blood cells must have recourse to plenty of free radicals in order to fulfill their function properly<B>[<A HREF="#radicals">11</A>]</B>.
So, while free radicals do harm to living cells, they are also necessary to promote the life of the organism. Too much free radicals and too little of it are equally harmful. The absence of Thanatos can have harmful consequences to life.
<BR><BR>      
Regression to infantilism in sectarian groups is an expression of Eros. Grown-up men thus give up their willpower. They are a chocking sight. Eventually, the leader tells them to kill themselves, an order which they readily fulfil, deprived as they are of individual willpower. The cult leader cuts the Mother's phallus off vicariously, because he is contemptuous of the mother-dependent male, which is really the painful truth about himself. Death has made the scene in the paradisal kindergarten. According to the bible, death came into existence when mankind was banished from the Garden, which signifies the lost unconscious symbiosis with creation. This theme is repeated in world mythology, as in the Australian aborigine story named "The Southern Cross", in which death enters creation when men become aware of sin. These myths seem to say that Thanatos is concomitant with ego consciousness, as shadow accompanies light. 
<BR><BR>Spiritual sages of all time have been misogynistic, in a sense, and warned against cohabitation with women, as the proselytes will tend to fall prey to the symbiotic unconsciousness of Eros. The Gnostics, especially, whose spiritual path revolved around enlightenment, 'gnosis' (heightened consciousness), were adamant about this. The majority subscribed to continence and a reclusive or monastic lifestyle. But there were Gnostics who went in the opposite direction and allowed free rein to sexuality. They also performed sexual rituals in open  before the congregation<B>[<A HREF="#Walker">12</A>]</B>. Eros is thus torn apart, through unnatural application of sexuality. The Gnostics were aware of this. By emptying the erotic drive, so they thought, they got rid of its coercive power. Thence they may give God undivided attention. 
<BR><BR>
At Egypt's Tahrir square, again, a Western female journalist was (June, 2012) sexually assaulted by a large group of men. She was "<I>violently attacked by a 'group of animals' who stripped her naked, scratched and clenched her breasts and 'forced their fingers inside her'</I>"<B>[<A HREF="#Tahrir">13</A>]</B>. Eros is restrained, alternatively women are raped, or recruited to group sex, etc. It is an expression of Thanatos and a serious impediment to Eros. In this way weak ego-consciousness defends against abatement in the symbiotic condition, a power set in motion by mass-movements such as the Arab Spring. It is very characteristic of certain ethnic groups in convergence with the modern world, on account of a low conscious level. The Holocaust and the many ethnic cleansings give us ample evidence of how unitive Eros is compensated by divisive Thanatos. 
<BR><BR>

      <B>Beyond Thanatos</B>
      <BR>
      <BR>
      The personality that has transcended the stage of &quot;ego wholeness&quot;, pertaining to the phallocentric economy, has no longer any need to control his/her environment in defense of the frail ego. Central to this notion is that Christ resides within us (cmp. Galatians: 2). Symbolically, it means, among other things, that the life-force resides within us, and is no longer accorded us from without, in the form of outer circumstances, either good or bad. In either case, God is always with us. Horus, likewise, is a god-man, which means that the divine spirit has its abode in the human heart. This generates a completely different psychological dynamic, and the transfer of sin to the environment is closed out. The motif of destructivity, the death drive, thus loses much of its impetus in the individual.

     However, the archaic psychic economy of maintaining ego wholeness still persists in the modern world. It obtains in morally inferior individuals, immature individuals, and in ethnic groups that lack a Christian phase in their history, corresponding to the European Middle Ages<B>[<A HREF="#Interiority">14</A>]</B>. Mass-immigration of ethnic groups belonging to the phallocentric cultural sphere, together with the ongoing secularization process, contribute to the resurgence of pre-Christian scapegoatism. A phallic-narcissistic economy implies that the ego territory must ever be expanded, its borders always defended, and personal shortcomings must be blamed on others, by way of transfer of sin.<BR><BR>
      <B>Conclusion</B>
      <BR>
      <BR>Certain psychoanalytic groups have been loathsome of the notion of the death drive. For most analysts it has been riven with problems, but I put forth an interpretation that makes sense of it. The contraposition of Eros and Thanatos, following Freud, is relevant in so far as Eros denotes the symbiotic power that works to achieve an unconscious and unreflective wholeness, whether its in the regressive form or vis-a-vis other beings. Thanatos can be understood as the force that defends the borders, particularly the incest barrier, taken in its wide meaning. Merger is resisted, sometimes even on pain of death. The ego, especially the weak ego, must maintain its borders as the symbiotic experience threatens its existence with unconscious dissolution. At least it faces regression to an earlier naive phase, something which invokes incestual fear. The ego is very reluctant to acquire any form of weakness. Bodily weakness is a lesser problem.<BR><BR> The weak ego, especially in the narcissistic personality, has a pronounced aversion to vulnerability in the other party, as it can beget chinks in his own armour. Thanatos is called up in an effort to neutralize symbiotic Eros. In the way of a projection, a little twig on the Mother tree is cut off vicariously. The projection occurs since the perpetrator himself is unconsciously an outgrowth on the Mother, not the least when his personality is merely a product of his own cultural and ethnic group. It represents the sacrifice of a <span class="nobr">limb &mdash;</span> a notorious motif. But the inferior personality can have an equally strong symbiotic drive when the other party conforms to collective ideals. <BR><BR>In the encounter with a personality of greater scope the delimitations of the ego are threatened. Advanced culture of greater scope activates Thanatos in the inferior personality. Since it is unmanageable to adapt, a personality of lesser scope is threatened with dissolution. Only if Eros is curbed can ego delimitations be upheld. The "Other" represents a threat to the inner narcissistic harmony formed upon vanity and self-conceit, which is ego wholeness. Such an encounter evokes true fear. That's why an encroaching symbiotic wholeness is closed out. Adjustment and assimilation are out of the question.<BR><BR>Destructivity, whether it's directed outward against the other party, or whether it takes the form of self-laceration, spoliates the threatening symbiotic wholeness, characteristic of the Eros function. According to legend, <span class="nobr">Saint Lucy's</span> betrothed admired her eyes, so she tore them out and gave them to him, saying, "<I>Now let me live to God</I>"<B>[<A HREF="#Lucy">15</A>]</B>. Thus, she managed to destroy an aspiring Eros wholeness, by way of self-mutilation. Self-mutilation is a notorious theme in the initiation rituals of primitives, and it has its modern counterparts, too. The young girl destroys her childish wholeness by getting an ugly tattoo, wearing vulgar clothes, inserting trinkets by piercing the nasal bone, etc. Evidently, she is not papa's girl anymore. The original wholeness is thus destroyed. This is a natural phase of emancipation that has serious pathological overtones. <BR><BR>In the modern Western individual, provided that his ego is strong and unneurotic, the Thanatos force has receded. But in the average citizen of phallocentric society this never occurs. To him the phallic force of Thanatos is indispensable for maintaining ego wholeness. The inferior form of masculinity is symbolically equated with the phallus of the Mother. It is like the little twig on the tree trunk of the Mother.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<span class="small">A spider indicates spinning, the spinning of fantasies. The superstition is that in the morning a spider means bad luck and in the evening good luck. Obviously that really means that if in the morning one is slack and sleepy, gets up late, and sits about half dressed and just thinks of one's neurotic problems, that would be the spider in the morning which would certainly bring bad luck. But if after working all day one lights a cigarette in the evening and sits in front of the house, as peasants do, and lets one's fantasy run, or if one philosophizes about life, that is quite all right, it is a very good way to prepare oneself for sleep. Therefore the spider in the evening is propitious, and that probably was the original meaning of this widespread suspersition. The spider is a negative mother symbol, it is the Maya, and so on. When it comes in the evening, or at the evening of life, it is all right, but it is very bad to start the day with it (Alchemy, 1980, Inner City Books, p.98).</span></BLOCKQUOTE><P>
