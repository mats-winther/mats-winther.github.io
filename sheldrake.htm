    <span class="bigger">Introduction</span><br>
    <br>
    Rupert Sheldrake&rsquo;s theory of &lsquo;formative causation&rsquo; bears striking similarities to physicist
    David&nbsp;Bohm&rsquo;s causal quantum theory, which posits a quantum field pervading the cosmos (cf. Encyc.,
    &lsquo;Formative causation&rsquo;). Bohm&rsquo;s theory suggests that local events instantaneously influence
    particle behaviour across the universe through this cosmic quantum field (cf. Wiki, &lsquo;De&nbsp;Broglie–Bohm
    theory&rsquo;).<br>
    <br>
    Such extreme &lsquo;non-locality&rsquo; conflicts with established scientific principles. The theory is further
    problematic in that it reifies the quantum field into a quasi-spiritual, universal force. By contrast, in
    Copenhagen quantum theory, both the quantum field and particle models remain theoretical constructs rather than
    ontological entities (cf. Faye, 2014).<br>
    <br>
    Sheldrake&rsquo;s theory encounters similar issues with non-locality, pushing it into the realm of religious
    philosophy. His concept of a morphogenetic field effectively describes an omniscient entity capable of perceiving
    and recording all universal events. This bears more resemblance to a pantheistic deity than a scientific
    mechanism.<br>
    <br>
    Where Schopenhauer posited The Will as the underlying reality, Sheldrake proposes The
    Memory&#8239;&mdash;&thinsp;both essentially spiritual forces continuously shaping existence. While religious
    perspectives have their place, there are more coherent theological frameworks available than Sheldrake&rsquo;s
    model.<br>
    <br>
    <span class="bigger">Regressive thinking</span><br>
    <br>
    Theories like those of Sheldrake and Bohm represent a step backward from Niels&nbsp;Bohr&rsquo;s modern conceptual
    framework, particularly his principle of complementarity. Bohr&rsquo;s Copenhagen interpretation, enthusiastically
    received by psychologists C.&#8239;G.&nbsp;Jung and <span class="nb">Marie-Louise von Franz,</span> gained
    widespread scientific acceptance through extensive experimental validation. In contrast, theories positing
    universal spiritual fields have consistently failed to gain traction in the scientific community, ultimately
    yielding to Bohr&rsquo;s model.<br>
    <br>
    For those interested in Neoplatonic speculation, the classical Neoplatonists and Gnostics offer more rewarding
    study, as their works vibrate with authentic psychological projections. Sheldrake&rsquo;s attempt to align himself
    with Jung is particularly problematic, as Jung&rsquo;s concept of the collective unconscious operates on
    fundamentally different principles than Sheldrake&rsquo;s theories.<br>
    <br>
    Theoretical models incorporating a World Soul or similar spiritual-material fusion represent a theoretical dead
    end. While developing religious worldviews has its place, cloaking them in scientific rhetoric undermines both
    genuine religious experience and scientific inquiry. This regression to outdated modes of thinking exemplifies a
    well-documented pattern in intellectual history. Von&nbsp;Franz says:</p>
    <blockquote>
      The idea of complementarity in physics is the same thing. It was first created by Niels&nbsp;Bohr and then very
      much picked up and propagated by Pauli, while Louis&nbsp;de&nbsp;Broglie, for instance, for several years wrote
      on those lines and then regressed and suddenly said that he could not accept it any more. At the same time he
      became friendly with the Communists. In other words, as Pauli put it, he could not stand the newness of the
      thought. It was too uncanny after awhile, so he had to regress to a mechanical view, as in the Communistic
      sciences, and with that discard the idea of complementarity. It is so difficult to give up an old thinking habit.
      Even people who have got an idea already, sometimes, after awhile, give it up again. (Von&nbsp;Franz, 1972,
      p.&#8239;219)
    </blockquote>
    <p style="margin-top:20px;"><span class="bigger">Pantheism</span><br>
    <br>
    Sheldrake&rsquo;s theory follows a familiar pattern, essentially recapitulating classical pantheism: a universal
    spirit pervades and merges with the material cosmos, directing even the smallest particle according to established
    patterns. This divine presence, manifest everywhere and always, lacks empirical support yet retains its appeal
    precisely because it expresses archetypal religious truths.<br>
    <br>
    Ken Wilber exemplifies a similar approach, clothing archetypal concepts in scientific terminology and New Age
    rhetoric. Despite his prolific output and pseudo-intellectual framework, the scientific substance remains minimal
    beneath the alluring archetypal ideas. Such thinkers might better serve as acknowledged religious leaders rather
    than pseudo-scientists. Embracing their role as modern shamans could position them legitimately among our
    civilization&rsquo;s religious and mystical thinkers, lending their work greater authenticity. Instead, their
    attempts to infiltrate scientific discourse merely appeal to those resistant to the genuine conceptual innovations
    of thinkers like Bohr and Jung, whose work represents seeds for future development.<br>
    <br>
    The concept of a universe endowed with psyche and memory&#8239;&mdash;&thinsp;effectively a cosmic
    consciousness&#8239;&mdash;&thinsp;holds perennial appeal and finds expression in both theology and comparative
    religion, even attracting Einstein&rsquo;s interest. While this suggests humanity&rsquo;s persistent need for
    religious understanding, these archetypal ideas might better serve to revitalize existing traditions, including
    Christianity, rather than masquerade as science.<br>
    <br>
    <span class="bigger">Metaphysical ideation and hypostatization</span><br>
    <br>
    The morphogenetic field represents a metaphysical concept. Traditional sciences also employ seemingly spiritual
    terms like &lsquo;force&rsquo; and &lsquo;energy&rsquo;. However, scientists regard energy merely as a convenient
    mathematical construct. Most don&rsquo;t believe in &lsquo;energy&rsquo; as an entity itself, since no one has
    directly observed this mysterious substance. Energy serves as an umbrella term for various phenomena like
    electricity and heat, but generic energy remains empirically unobservable.<br>
    <br>
    Why then employ a concept so reminiscent of religious &lsquo;spirit&rsquo;? Because empirical observation supports
    its utility. Physical reality behaves <i>as if</i> energy underlies phenomena, enabling scientists to formulate
    principles like the Conservation of Energy and establish equivalences between potential and kinetic energy
    (mgy&nbsp;= ½mv²). Empirical data consistently confirms these mathematical relationships, with remarkable
    precision.<br>
    <br>
    This explains scientists&rsquo; apparent adoption of &lsquo;spiritual&rsquo; terminology. These abstractions serve
    as predictive tools for empirical observations. Their surprising effectiveness in describing reality continues to
    amaze researchers. Nevertheless, scientists maintain that concepts like &lsquo;field&rsquo; and
    &lsquo;energy&rsquo; remain convenient abstractions rather than metaphysical entities. Unlike gods or spirits,
    these concepts aren&rsquo;t hypostatized into independent metaphysical realities.<br>
    <br>
    The &lsquo;morphic field&rsquo;, by contrast, lacks empirical substantiation. It fails to predict phenomenal world
    behaviour, distinguishing it fundamentally from scientific abstractions. Its inability to align with observable
    reality renders it scientifically useless.<br>
    <br>
    Ideas that prove ineffective in describing reality often undergo hypostatization&#8239;&mdash;&thinsp;elevation to
    supernatural status. Sheldrake follows this pattern by attributing substantial, though immaterial, reality to his
    morphic field when empirical support proves lacking. This parallels Plato&rsquo;s response when his social theories
    found no practical application&#8239;&mdash;&thinsp;he elevated his entire philosophy to an ethereal realm of
    eternal Ideas.<br>
    <br>
    Contemporary scientists can avoid hypostatizing their ideas because these ideas demonstrate practical utility in
    empirical reality, generating natural acceptance. This allows them the luxury of modesty, characterizing their
    concepts as mere conveniences while remaining agnostic about reality&rsquo;s underlying nature. In contrast, modern
    shamans like Sheldrake must assert metaphysical insight precisely because their ideas lack empirical validation.
    They posit metaphysical realities and sacred fields as fundamental to physical existence.<br>
    <br>
    <span class="bigger">Archetypal ultimate truth</span><br>
    <br>
    Consider an analogy: paper money&rsquo;s value rests entirely on collective belief. Should faith in this
    intrinsically worthless paper falter, catastrophe would follow. The system functions only because each participant
    trusts they can exchange these papers for genuine goods&#8239;&mdash;&thinsp;the car dealer accepts them knowing
    others will do the same for food or services. This collective agreement, though essentially a shared fiction,
    proves highly functional.<br>
    <br>
    Were this monetary faith to collapse, we might imagine bank directors emerging from their institutional temples to
    proclaim: &lsquo;Behold! This currency embodies the eternal, celestial Money that existed since time&rsquo;s
    dawn&#8239;&mdash;&thinsp;the very substance with which the Creator purchased Earth from the Chaos dragon to
    fashion our world&hellip;&rsquo;<br>
    <br>
    This illustrates the historical role of high priests: maintaining social order by connecting mundane reality to
    transcendent meaning. They enabled society&rsquo;s continuation by investing everyday life with metaphysical
    significance. Modern shamans attempt something similar, establishing metaphysical frameworks. As Jung observed:</p>
    <blockquote>
      If we are convinced that we know the ultimate truth concerning metaphysical things, this means nothing more than
      that archetypal images have taken possession of our powers of thought and feeling, so that these lose their
      quality as functions at our disposal. The loss shows itself in the fact that the object of perception then
      becomes absolute and indisputable and surrounds itself with such emotional taboo that anyone who presumes to
      reflect on it is automatically branded a heretic and blasphemer. (Jung, 1977, para.&#8239;787)
    </blockquote>
    <p style="margin-top:20px;"><span class="bigger">Neoplatonic respectability</span><br>
    <br>
    Those not seeking scientific validation remain free to develop Neoplatonic innovations. Cosmologist
    Gustaf&nbsp;Strömberg (1882&#8239;-&thinsp;1962) developed such a theory of organizational waves or
    &lsquo;genii&rsquo; that closely parallels Sheldrake&rsquo;s morphogenetic fields. Despite its rather naive
    formulation, his work earned reviews from luminaries like Einstein and Eddington. In &lsquo;The Soul of the
    Universe&rsquo; (1940), Strömberg describes a hierarchical system of non-material genii directing particle
    behaviour and biological morphogenesis. These indigenous genii structures exist independently of matter, with
    certain waves functioning as nature&rsquo;s memory banks. Memory thus becomes a fundamental natural property.
    Strömberg&rsquo;s framework culminates in an all-encompassing World Soul, while specialized
    &lsquo;gene-spirits&rsquo; interact with chromosomal genes.<br>
    <br>
    Strömberg candidly acknowledges his theory as a modernized version of Aristotelian entelechy, recognizing its
    kinship with Hans&nbsp;Driesch&rsquo;s vitalism and its departure from modern scientific principles in positing
    spiritual fields. His organizational model extends beyond Sheldrake&rsquo;s, incorporating not only accumulated
    memory but also evolutionary leaps triggered by the World Soul&rsquo;s emission of subordinate structures.<br>
    <br>
    Sheldrake&rsquo;s followers would benefit from studying Strömberg&rsquo;s work, as it reveals their theory&rsquo;s
    true nature beneath its pseudo-scientific veneer: a fundamentally Neoplatonic and Gnostic worldview built on
    spirit-matter dualism. Unlike Sheldrake, Strömberg openly embraces his theory&rsquo;s religious character,
    producing an engaging revival of Plotinian concepts. The enduring appeal of the World Soul concept deserves
    recognition, and Sheldrake might better serve his ideas by acknowledging his intellectual predecessors, including
    Strömberg and Emanuel&nbsp;Swedenborg (1653&#8239;-&thinsp;1735), rather than distancing himself from this rich
    theoretical lineage.</p>
