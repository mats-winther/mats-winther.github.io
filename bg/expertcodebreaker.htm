      <I>Expert Codebreaker</I> is an implementation for Zillions of a game similar to <I>Mastermind,</I> although more difficult. Digits are used instead of colours. The computer chooses a pattern of five digits. In the standard variant it uses digits 1-6. Duplicates are allowed, so the computer could even choose the same five digits. To invoke a random hidden code, press &lsquo;Start Thinking&rsquo;. The chosen pattern is placed upmost but hidden to the player. If you give up and want to view the code, press &lsquo;Switch Piece Set&rsquo;.<BR><BR>
The codebreaker must try to guess the pattern, in both order and correct digit, within nine turns. Each guess is made by placing a row of code digits on the decoding board. Once placed, the program provides feedback by placing from zero to five key pegs at the sideboard. A black key peg is placed for each code digit from the guess which is correct in both digit and position; a white peg indicates that a correct digit is placed in the wrong position. The black pegs are always placed leftmost, so there is no correlation of position. Once feedback is provided, another guess is made; guesses and feedback continue to alternate until either the codebreaker guesses correctly, or nine incorrect guesses are made.<BR><BR>
Mastermind or Master Mind is a code-breaking board game for two players, invented in 1970 by Mordecai&nbsp;Meirowitz, an Israeli postmaster and telecommunications expert. A similar pencil and paper game, called bulls and cows, was played at least as far back as the early 1960&rsquo;s (Wikipedia). With 5 positions and 6 digits, there are 6<SUP>5</SUP>&nbsp;= 7776 different patterns. The standard version, with variants, has also been implemented (see <A HREF="codebreaker.htm" title="Mastermind">Codebreaker</A>). <BR><BR>
