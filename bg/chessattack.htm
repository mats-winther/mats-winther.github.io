<P><br>
The rules are like standard chess, including long castling, pawn double-step, and &lsquo;en passant&rsquo;. A light piece is worth two pawns on this small board. To sacrifice a light piece for two pawns is a sound strategy. The game seems to work, because one could lose if one plays carelessly. The game is designed for children, since it is easier for them to learn chess on this small board.

Chess Attack was published by Norway company Yes Games AS in 2008. (Inventor unknown.) The game was endorsed by World Champion Magnus&nbsp;Carlsen and Alexandra&nbsp;Kosteniuk (Wikipedia). The first miniature chess variant, Petty Chess, was invented by B.&nbsp;Walker&nbsp;Watson and published in September 1930 in a letter to British Chess Magazine.
