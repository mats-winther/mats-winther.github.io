      In Crook Chess, the interesting tactical capabilities of the <a href="chinesechess.htm" title="Chinese Chess (XiangQi)">Chinese Cannon</a> is introduced in a standard chess context. The rooks are replaced by Crooks (Cannon-Rooks). This magic piece can change movement capability by using up a move to transform itself. A Crook rook can change into a Crook cannon by turning the rook upside down, or vice versa. The Crook cannon uses Chinese Cannon movement: it moves as a rook or jumps a piece to capture. It is somewhat weaker than a knight, but its tactical capability is great. In any case, the Crook cannon can always transform itself back into a Crook rook, which is the same as a normal rook. Note! After the piece is transformed it must make a move before making yet another transformation. Thus, it&rsquo;s not possible to stay put and make continual transformations on the same square.
The Crook has great attacking potential and is easier to maneuvre than the clumsy rook. It is more valuable than a rook, but it costs time to transform back and forth between its cannon and rook guises. See also my <A HREF="warlockchess.htm">Warlock Chess</a>.
