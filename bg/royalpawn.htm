      The goal is to checkmate the <I>Royal Pawn,</I> initially positioned at e2 and e7.
      <BR>
      <BR>
      1. A Royal Pawn can&#39;t move through check or into check, that is, it cannot pass or enter a threatened square (including &#39;en passant&#39; situations).
      <BR>
      2. In the unlikely event the Royal Pawn reaches the eighth rank, that shall count as a win.
      <BR>
      3. The non-royal King can castle, even if the squares are threatened.
      <BR>
      4. The Royal Pawn must move as any other pawn.
      <BR>
      5. In all other respects the rules are the same as in regular chess.
      <BR>
      <BR>
      Needless to say, make no early advances with the Royal Pawn, but keep it protected. Remember that the King is now a regular piece, having the same value as a Bishop or Knight. It is very suitable as an escort to the Royal Pawn. Try to activate the King early (don&#39;t hide it in the corner as is usual). This is a very tactical game where you can ferociously sacrifice all pieces to get to the enemy Royal Pawn. Games are often short. This variant was invented by Jeremy&nbsp;Good.
