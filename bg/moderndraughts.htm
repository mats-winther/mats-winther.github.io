	<i>Modern draughts</i> (also called <span class="nobr"><i>Killer Light</i>&thinsp;)</span> is a variant of Dame (International Draughts). The Dame must land immediately behind the last captured piece, provided (1)&nbsp;that it is a Dame and (2)&nbsp;it&rsquo;s a multiple capture sequence. This serves to reduce the drawishness of the game, since it means that three Dames will win against 
a lone Dame. Note that, unlike in Killer Draughts (<a href="killerdraughts.htm" title="Killer Draughts (improved International draughts)">here</a>), the halt rule is not valid at single piece capture.
		
<BR><BR>
<span class="bigger">Background</span>
<BR><BR>
In 1922, Dutch champion A.K.W.&nbsp;Damme proposed to use the Dame halt rule after the final piece (Man or Dame) only. Around 2000, Christian&nbsp;Freeling proposed Killer Draughts (<a href="killerdraughts.htm" title="Killer Draughts (improved International draughts)">here</a>) by introducing condition &ldquo;only after a final Dame&rdquo;. In 2016, Juri&nbsp;Anikejev suggested &ldquo;Killer light&rdquo; (Modern Draughts) by introducing &ldquo;only after a final Dame in multiple capture sequences&rdquo;. The Dame halt rule is well-known in Gothic checkers variants (<a href="gothiccheckersvariants.htm" title="Gothic Checkers Variants">here</a>), although the rule also applies to enemy men.
<BR><BR>
An interesting variant was suggested by World Champion H.&nbsp;Hoogland, in 1923. The only difference is that the Dame can also capture orthogonally, but only when a Dame can be captured. Thus, two Dames will win against a lone Dame. (This is implemented as a variant.)
<BR><BR>
<span class="bigger">Piece movement</span>
<BR><BR>
The object is to capture all your opponent&rsquo;s men by jumping over them, or
		stalemate the opponent so he has no moves. A Man can move 
		forward, by a diagonal step to an adjacent empty square. It 
		may also jump over an enemy piece in any diagonal direction to a
		vacant square on the other side.  Jumping over a piece captures it.   
		Capturing is
		mandatory, and you must keep jumping and capturing as long as it is possible.
		You must even choose beforehand the series of jumps that captures the most men.
		When your Man reaches the other end of the board, it becomes a Dame and can 
		then move and capture forwards and backwards over any distance. It also
		jumps to capture, but only one Man at a time. A Dame must also choose the line that 
		captures the most men. If a Man reaches the promotion square as part of a capture sequence, it does not promote.

<span class="bigger">Modern Checkers (8x8)</span>
<BR><BR>
<I>Modern Checkers (8x8)</I> is played on an 8x8 board with 12 pieces per player. The only difference from Brazilian Checkers (Minor Polish draughts) is the following: in a capture sequence (but not single capture), the Dame must stop on the first vacant square after the last captured piece, if and only if that piece is also a Dame. Minor Polish draughts was known already in the 16th century, and possibly even earlier. It was a popular board game in Holland, especially in Amsterdam.
