      The <I>Gaul</I> is a <A HREF="bifurcation.htm">bifurcation piece.</A> It captures like a bishop, but makes non-capturing moves in two legs, by leaping diagonally over an intervening piece and temporarily land on the empty square immediately behind the piece. From there it slides like a rook on any of the two orthogonals in the prolonged movement direction. The Gaul&#39;s value is 3, that is, the same as a bishop or knight (preliminary estimate). The Gaul is dependent on &#39;screens&#39; for moving, but as it can capture directly on the diagonals it can have a positional influence also when it&#39;s unable to make non-capturing moves. Other rules are the same as in standard chess, except for the possible promotion to Gaul. Gaul Chess can also be played with <I>Kwaggas</I> instead of knights. Gaul Chess, and the new Gaul piece, were invented by undersigned, October 2006.

The screens, that are used for leaping, occur anywhere on the first leg. Should the screen be an enemy piece it can be captured.
