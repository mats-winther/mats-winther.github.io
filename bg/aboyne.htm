     A stone may (1) move to an adjacent empty cell or (2)&nbsp;jump over a friendly stone, or a line of friendly stones, landing on the cell immediately beyond. If that cell is occupied by an enemy stone, that stone is captured. Capture is not mandatory. A stone cannot move into the opponent&rsquo;s goal cell. <i>Note!</i> A stone that is adjacent to any enemy stone cannot move.<br><br>
The winner is the player who moves a stone into their own goal cell (at the opposite end of the board) or stalemates the opponent. Aboyne was designed by Paul&nbsp;Sijben in 1995.
