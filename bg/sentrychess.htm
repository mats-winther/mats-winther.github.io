   The only difference between <i>Sentry Chess</i> and regular chess is that the pawn has an extra capture capability forwards (northward), provided (1)&nbsp;that the friendly king is directly behind it (i.e. to the south) and (2)&nbsp;that the pawn is positioned on the other half of the board (that is, if it has reached the 5th rank or beyond). This means that all non-trivial <b>K</b>&nbsp;+ <b>P</b> versus <b>K</b> endgames are won. Such a pawn, reinforced by the king, is called <i>Sentry</i>. There is a similar rule in Chinese Chess (Xiangqi), where the pawn gets additional capture capabilities as soon as it has passed the middle of the board.
<b>Note!</b> In an <i>alternative</i> variant, the pawn can only acquire this forward capture capability if it has reached the seventh rank.
