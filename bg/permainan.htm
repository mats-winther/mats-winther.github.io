      <i>Permainan-Tabal</i> derives from Indonesia. It is interesting while it is a finely working intermediary between Alquerque and Draughts. The game is also known as <I>Dama</I>. Counters can move forwards and sideways. Capture, by the short leap, is performed in all directions. Capture is compulsory. Counters are obliged to follow the pattern on the board. Goal is to capture all the opponent&rsquo;s counters. Counters are promoted to Kings at the last rank. The King moves and captures in all directions. It can move any number of squares, like the King in international draughts, and land anywhere behind a captured piece. In endgames, a majority of only one King is sufficient for a win.

      A counter moves to an empty adjacent point. If an adjacent point is occupied by an enemy counter and the point directly behind is vacant, then one can jump over it and capture it, as in checkers. Several pieces may be captured like this in a single turn. Captured counters are removed instantly from the board.
