      The <I>Provocator</I> is a <A HREF="bifurcation.htm">bifurcation piece.</A> The <I>Provocator</I> moves by colliding diagonally against any piece, and then deviating to any of the two adjacent orthogonals (in the prolonged movement direction). It captures on the second leg only. The Provocator <I>can also move by colliding against the margin,</I> whereby only one movement direction is available after collision. Without screens to collide against the Provocator cannot move. The Provocator&#39;s value is the same as a knight or bishop (my estimate). Other rules are the same as in standard chess, except for the possible promotion to Provocator. As it can move only by coordinating with another piece, the Provocator is a highly cooperative piece, something which makes it interesting to the positional player. The structure on the board decides its possibilities. The Provocator has the interesting capacity of zigzaging between the pieces in the middlegame. It loses less power in the endgame than one would expect. Although screens for colliding become fewer, its scope and mobility also increases. The Provocator&#39;s capacity to collide with the margin is an important capacity. Provocator Chess can also be played with <I>Kwaggas</I> instead of knights (see <A HREF="bodyguardchess.htm">Bodyguard Chess</A>). Provocator Chess, and the new Provocator piece, were invented by undersigned, February 2007.

Both movement and capture occur on the second leg (red = capture).
