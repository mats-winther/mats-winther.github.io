      Any pawn move (including capture, &#39;en passant&#39;, and double-step) causes an enemy piece (including pawns), located on the same file, to be dislocated one square toward the moving pawn (if empty space exists). This is reminiscent of a magnetic effect. Other rules are similar to regular chess.

      In the opening phase one would want to avoid developing the opponent&#39;s pawns, by way of magnetic pawn moves. However, one must keep in mind that the opponent is often forced to return the favour. It&#39;s often a good idea to put the bishops on the long diagonal because the defending pawn on the knight file is easily dislocated. This is a curious game, but it works fine. Magneticpawns Chess was invented and implemented by undersigned, October 2006.
