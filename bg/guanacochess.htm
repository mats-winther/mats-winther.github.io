      <I>Guanaco Chess</I> features the <I>Guanaco,</I> belonging to the <A HREF="llamapieces.htm">Lama</A> family of pieces. They jump orthogonally on every second square, but have only four capture squares.

It can also step, and capture, one square orthogonally. Its value is somewhat less than a knight. A peculiarity is that jumps are allowed even if it has a capture possibility on the first square.</p>

      <I>Extended castling:</I> besides normal castling one can choose to move the king three squares instead of two. The rook ends up on its usual square. The corner square provides a hiding nest for the king should the player want to invoke play on the same wing and advance with the pawns. The extended castle rule also makes play on the wings easier to achieve. Queenside castle becomes more attractive. The extra corner squares will enhance the strategical possibilities. Try placing the king on the extra corner square, advance the g-pawn (or b-pawn), and follow up with rooks from behind. The king will be safe and will not stand in the way of the rooks.
