      The objective is checkmate. Pieces move as in orthodox chess, with the exception of the additional piece, the &quot;Zeppelin&quot;. The Zeppelin flies to any empty square orthogonally, ie. the rook-directions. This means that it can also fly directly, from one of the extra corner squares, to the opposite corner square in the enemy position. It captures an enemy piece by landing immediately beyond its victim. On this board the Zeppelin&#39;s value corresponds to a bishop (estimate).

      Extended castle rule: when castling the king may jump three squares, but it can also jump two as usual. The rook ends up on its usual square. The extended castle rule makes play on the wings easier to achieve. The king can immediately control the kingside corner square thus preventing the intervention of a Zeppelin.

      The Zeppelin cannot force a mate together with a king. The defending party can step into the corner. If you advance too boldly with the pawns, they can easily become victims of the Zeppelin. The Zeppelin piece is a weaker version of the Airplane, which was invented by R.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;Schmittberger for his <A HREF="airplanechess.htm">Airplane Chess</A>, 1981. The Airplane can also move in the diagonal directions.

      There is an alternative variant with &quot;Crabs&quot; instead of pawns. In yet another variant &quot;Kwaggas&quot; take the place of the knights. The Kwagga, which is my invention, moves like an extended knight, 3+1. It can multiply jumps, but only capture on the first.

It captures an enemy piece by landing immediately beyond its victim. The Dragonet&#39;s value is 4, i.e. light piece + pawn (estimate). It&#39;s a colourbound modification, by me, of Schmittberger&#39;s Airplane.</p>
