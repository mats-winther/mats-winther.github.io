      In Warlock Chess the rooks are replaced by &quot;Warlocks&quot;. This magic piece can change movement capability by using up a move to transform itself. A Warlock rook can change into a Warlock cannon by turning the rook upside down, or vice versa. The Warlock cannon uses Korean Cannon movement: it moves as a rook after having jumped a piece. If it cannot jump then it cannot move. As such, it is somewhat weaker than a knight, but its tactical capacity is great. In any case, the Warlock cannon can always transform itself back into a Warlock rook. After the piece is transformed it must make a move before making yet another transformation. So it&#39;s not possible to stay put and make continual transformations on the same square.

      The Warlock has great attacking potential, and it&#39;s much easier to maneuvre than the clumsy rook. It is more valuable than a rook, but it costs time to transform back and forth between its cannon and rook guises. Warlock means sorcerer, witch, or conjurer. There is also a variant with an <A HREF="improvedchess.htm">improved pawn</A>, which has an additional movement direction.
