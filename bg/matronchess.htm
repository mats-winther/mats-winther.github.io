      In <I>Matron Chess</I> a queen (also called Matron) may not capture a queen if the latter is guarded (visually guarded is enough). In all other respects it&#39;s the same as orthochess. In Matron Chess the queens cannot be exchanged directly, but only indirectly. As a result games become more aggressive and less drawish. Note that the queen counts as guarded even if the guarding piece is pinned (this simplifies matters). The Matron queen has great attacking potential. Bishop&#39;s opening serves as an example. After <B>1.e4 e5 2.Bc4</B> black cannot reply <B>2...Bc5</B> because after <B>3.Qh5</B> black cannot effectively defend the f7 square. There is also a variant with an <A HREF="improvedchess.htm">improved pawn</A>, which has an additional movement direction.
