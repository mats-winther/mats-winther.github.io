  <P><I>Nam Dinh</I> is a traditional game from Vietnam. Both the soldiers and the king move one square along the line in any direction. They capture by jumping over a <I>friendly</I> piece, landing on an enemy piece. (It is not allowed to jump over an enemy piece.) Capture is not mandatory. A soldier is prohibited from capturing a king. You win by checkmating or stalemating your opponent&rsquo;s King.<BR><BR>Nam Dinh uses the same board pattern as the medieval European game Alquerque (<A HREF="medievalalquerque.htm" title="Medieval Alquerque">here</A>). The source for the game is a Czech book by Zapletal (1991). According to
an article in Variant Chess, 61, 2009, Zapletal bases his
description on information from someone called Z.&nbsp;Hartmann who had seen the game
played by natives of Nam Dinh, a province in the Red River Delta region of northern Vietnam. Accordingly, I have chosen the name Nam Dinh for this game, because I don&rsquo;t know the native name. It has also been denoted Vietnamese Chess, but this is improper since there is really no relation to chess. Vietnamese Chess is actually the name of a Xiangqi variant. 
<BR><BR>
This new implementation of Nam Dinh uses the better understood rules, as clarified by Robert&nbsp;Reid. The earlier rules are based on a misunderstanding. It is said that the soldiers cannot capture. But this renders a game that is boring, since it is all about shuffling pieces. What&rsquo;s worse, it is a win for the first party in two moves: <B>1.Sd2-c3 Kc5xe3 2.Sd1-d2</B> checkmate! (Due to the fact that the soldiers cannot capture they are unable to move after black&rsquo;s first move, and the king is forced into a checkmate.) 
<BR><BR>
The correct rule is this: the soldiers cannot capture <I>a king.</I> It seems likely that the two last words have simply been dropped in the faulty rendition. This renders a fine game that demands great skill. It does not appear to be drawish, although non-trivial endgames with 3 versus 3 pieces should be regarded a draw. The privileged king rule also appears in Italian Damone (<A HREF="italiandamone.htm" title="Italian Damone">here</A>) and the Sámi Dablo games (Dablo Daares, etc., <A HREF="dablodaares.htm" title="Dablo Daares">here</A>), which have also been implemented in Zillions.
