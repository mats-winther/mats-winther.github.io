          Pieces move as in orthodox chess, with the exception of the additional piece, the Jetplane. The Jetplane flies to any empty square, orthogonally or diagonally. It captures the last piece it flew over (if it&rsquo;s an enemy piece). The Jetplane&rsquo;s value is the same as rook. It cannot always force a mate in endgames with King and Jetplane against King. The extra corner squares (the &ldquo;hangars&rdquo;) aren&rsquo;t accessible to any piece. They are only used as hangars for the Jetplanes.<BR><BR>
The Jetplane was inspired by R.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;Schmittberger&rsquo;s Airplane, but is more powerful. 
   It&rsquo;s is a very agile piece that can easily create threats against enemy pieces. It&rsquo;s main weakness is that it cannot give mate together with the king. Another variant features the Orthojet, which can only fly orthogonally.
