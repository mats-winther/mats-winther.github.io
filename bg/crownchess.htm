<P><BR>In <I>Crown Chess</I> a Crownprincess (also called Adjutant) replaces
the queen. The Crownprincess slides in any direction, but on the orthogonals it
slides only on one colour. The opposite colour squares are simply ignored. The
value of the Crownprincess is at least 6, that is, at least the same as rook +
pawn, or two light pieces. The Crownprincess is really an enhanced bishop that
can also move orthogonally. Its main weakness is that it cannot give mate
together with the king. In all other respects this variant is like standard
chess.<BR><BR>The Crownprincess can only visit half the squares of the board.
Despite this, it holds a value greater than a rook, which makes it a very
interesting piece. The strategical tension becomes greater because the
Crownprincess cannot simply be exchanged with a rook. At least two light pieces,
or rook + pawn, is equivalent to a Crownprincess. This creates a game which is
all but trivial. Due to its great value it cannot simply block enemy pieces.
Note that the Crownprincesses cannot be exchanged with each other because they
move on different square colours. Thus, early and shallow endgames cannot easily
occur.<BR><BR> This is a piece which is easily graspable, and very agile. When
it is exchanged, an unbalanced position, in terms of piece types, will result.
It seems like the Crownprincess is a good substitute for the queen. Remember
that the bishop moving on the same square colour as the enemy Crownprincess is
more valuable than the other bishop. The king is not as vulnerable in Crown
Chess as in Fide-chess. It is usually safe to remain in the centre with the
king. The Crownprincess also appears in my <A HREF="adjutantchess1.htm">Adjutant
