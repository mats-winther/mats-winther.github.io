      <I>Stratagemo</I> is a game similar to the popular battle game Stratego (Stratego was invented in 1961 by the Milton Bradley Company. Stratego is today a registered trademark of Hasbro&nbsp;Inc). The goal of the game is to capture your opponent&rsquo;s Standard. You also win if your opponent doesn&rsquo;t have any moves left.

      <span class="bigger">Rules</span>
      <BR>
      <BR>
      <B>1.</B> The piece with the lower number beats the piece with the higher number.
      <BR>
      <B>2.</B> The Assassin (&lsquo;A&rsquo;) can only beat the Commandant (&lsquo;1&rsquo;) and only if the Assassin attacks first.
      <BR>
      <B>3.</B> When any piece (except a Disarmer - &lsquo;8&rsquo;) strikes a Mine, that piece is lost and removed from the board. When a Disarmer strikes a Mine, the Mine is defused and removed. <I>Note! In Stratagemo the Disarmer can also defuse friendly Mines.</I>

      In Stratagemo the player who begins (typically red) places all his pieces first (in this stage one doesn&rsquo;t change turns). After all pieces have been placed the opponents take turns to move pieces by the following rules. All pieces, except a Scout (&lsquo;9&rsquo;) move only one square up, down, left or right. A Scout can move any number of squares in these directions.

    <UL>
      <LI>Place Mines around the Standard to protect it.
      </LI>
      <LI>Put a few lower-numbered pieces in the front line, but be careful! If you lose them early in the game you&rsquo;re in a weak position.
      </LI>
      <LI>A few Scouts should be in the front lines to help you discover the strength of opposing pieces.
      </LI>
      <LI>Place some Disarmers in the rear for the end of the game, where they will be needed to defuse Mines.
      </LI>
      <LI>Remember that the Assassin is, after all, an important piece while it can protect a flank against the enemy Commandant.
