<P><B>Dablot Prejjesne</B> (Dablo)<BR><BR>  This game was played among the
Lapps in Sweden. The name is Laplandish and means &quot;To play Dablo on a
board.&quot; The first party represents the Lapps, and the second party
represents the peasants. <BR><BR>  Goal is to capture the enemy royal pieces:
the King and the Prince. All pieces, King (&quot;g&aring;nneka&quot;), Prince (&quot;g&aring;nnekan
alke&quot;), and Soldier (&quot;d&aring;rake&quot;), can step and capture, by
the short leap, in all directions. Capture is mandatory. One can only capture a
piece of the same rank or lower. Pieces are ranked: King, Prince, and Soldier.
Promotion does not occur.<BR><BR>  A piece moves to an empty adjacent point. 
If an adjacent point is occupied by an enemy piece, of the same rank or lower,
and the point directly behind is vacant, then one can jump over it and capture
it, as in checkers.  Several pieces may be captured like this in a single turn.<BR><BR>
 As capture is mandatory, it is possible to sacrifice one or more Soldiers, and
force the enemy Prince or King into a trap, whereby it is captured. But it is
not always adequate to make such combinations, if it leaves the opponent with a
clear majority of Soldiers, together with his remaining royal piece.<BR><BR> 
Note that, if you capture the opponent's last remaining royal piece, then you
must finish any remaining multiple captures before the win takes effect.<BR><BR>
 The Dablo pieces were carved in wood. An interesting fact is that the board has
the same type of pattern as the African game Kharbaga, and the capture rules are
reminiscent of the Italian game Damone.<BR><BR>  Nils Keyland's rendition of
Dablot Prejjesne does not work. The game is very tedious when capture is not
mandatory, and you must remove all enemy pieces to win. Possibly  the original
rules were forgotten among the Lapps. In order to end the game, when only few
pieces remain (likely to occur after 200 moves or so) the players are expected
to move straight forward with the pieces (although the pieces can also move
backwards), and the player who is lucky enough to arrive at a position where he
has the capture right can win the game. This is a completely erratic rule that
must have been invented in late times to try to make sense of the game.<BR><BR>
 Instead I propose that it's enough to capture the royal pieces to win. I also
propose that capture is mandatory, so that it becomes possible to capture the
royal pieces by way of sacrificial combinations. With these rules the game
becomes strategically and tactically very interesting. The games become
appropriately long with this rule. This rule is reminiscent of Italian Damone
variants, where capture of the Damones is sufficient for a win. Both variants
have been implemented.<BR><BR><BR><BR>   Reference: <BR><BR>
