      The <I>Crossbishop</I> is a <A HREF="bifurcation.htm">bifurcation piece.</A> It slides like a rook. It can make a capture by jumping over a piece of any colour. If an enemy piece is positioned immediately behind the jumped piece it will be captured (this is a &quot;strong&quot; Crossbishop). But if the square behind the jumped piece is empty then the Crossbishop continue <I>diagonally</I> in the prolonged movement direction (two alternative directions), and capture an enemy piece. The strong Crossbishop&#39;s value is 5, that is, the same as a rook. Otherwise the rules are the same as in standard chess, except for the possible promotion to Crossbishop.

      Although the Crossbishop loses &#39;screens&#39; to jump over when the pieces become fewer, it becomes more mobile when the orthogonals are cleared from pieces. Thus it often retains its value in the endgame. Note that the Crossbishop can have a big influence from behind the friendly pawn chain, especially if it can slide along the first rank. <I>Crossbishop Chess (8x10)</I> and the new Crossbishop piece, were invented by undersigned, August 2006.

            <IMG ALT="Crossbishop movement" SRC="gifs/crossbishop1.gif" style="float:left; margin-right: 10px;">The Crossbishop, slides like a rook, but captures by a jump followed by a bishop&#39;s slide. Had there been an enemy piece at the position marked with a green ring, it could have been captured (as this is a &quot;strong&quot; Crossbishop).
