	<i>Black and White</i> is played on an 8x8 board with 12 pieces per player. It is similar to English Checkers, although White&rsquo;s pieces are placed on white squares and Black&rsquo;s on black squares. A Man (&ldquo;Singleton&rdquo;) steps diagonally forward. Yet, it can only capture <i>orthogonally</i>; sideways and forward. When it reaches the opposite end of the board, it is crowned. It can thereafter move and capture both backward and forward. It is not mandatory to capture the longest line. In this game, Zugzwang plays a much bigger role than combinations. In the endgame, two Kings against one is a win. This checkers variant was invented by <a href="http://parlettgames.uk/" title="Gourmet Games">David&nbsp;Parlett</a>.

		The object is to capture all your opponent&rsquo;s men by jumping over them, or
		stalemate the opponent so he has no moves. A Man can step diagonally
		forward to an adjacent empty square. It captures by
		jumping over an enemy piece in the orthogonal directions to a
		vacant square on the other side.  
		Capturing is
		mandatory, and you must keep jumping as long as possible.
		When your Man reaches the other end of the board, it becomes a King. It can 
		move and capture both forward and backward.
