<P><br>
Mozambican Checkers is unique in that one must give preference to the capture sequence with the highest combined piece value. A Man counts as one and a King counts as two. Thus, if you can capture either three Men or two Kings, then you must choose the latter. If the sequences have equal value, then one may choose either one.
Mozambican Checkers is played on a mirrored 8x8 board with 12 Men per player. A Man steps diagonally forward. It captures by the short leap in the four diagonal directions. Capturing is mandatory. The King is &ldquo;long&rdquo;: it can 
slide and capture over any distance. A Man is not promoted if it temporarily lands on a promotion square during a capture sequence. This variant is played all over Mozambique.
