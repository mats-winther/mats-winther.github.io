  <P><br><br>The only difference between &ldquo;Torpedo Chess&rdquo; and regular chess is that a pawn can always move one or two squares straight ahead. (In standard chess, the double step is only possible when the pawn is positioned on the second rank.) It means that the &lsquo;en passant&rsquo; move is possible everywhere, too.
<br><br>
  The pawn is much more dangerous in this variant, both in the endgame and in the middlegame. Moving the pawn only one step in the opening allows it to jump to the enemy side in the next move. A pawn storm on the flank is more likely to succeed, because it is so fast. This variant has been investigated by former World Champion Vladimir&nbsp;Kramnik, together with the AlphaZero team. (Inventor unknown.)
<br><br>
In &ldquo;Semi-Torpedo Chess&rdquo; a pawn can only move two squares from the second or third rank. This variant is not as wild. It has also been implemented.
