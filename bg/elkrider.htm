      In Elkrider Chess &quot;Elkriders&quot; take the place of the Rooks. The Elkrider moves differently depending on the colour of the square. If positioned on a black square it moves like a Rook. If positioned on a white square it moves like a Nightrider: it can make continuous Knight jumps in the same direction, provided that the interim squares are empty. The Elkrider&#39;s value is 5, that is, the same as a Rook. Castling is performed with an Elkrider instead of a Rook. In regular chess the Rooks play a passive role in the first half of the game. The new Elkrider piece has part of the Rook&#39;s power, which can now be utilized early in the game. It is powerful enough to give mate to a lonely King. The Elkrider&#39;s image also changes when it moves to a square with a different colour (it rotates). This makes it easier to understand the piece.

      The elk (amer. &quot;moose&quot;) has actually been trained for battle service, in the cavalry of Charles&nbsp;XII of Sweden (1682-1718). Elks are much faster and more powerful than horses. However, it proved a time-consuming and costly task to train elks so the project was abandoned.

      The Elkrider is a very interesting piece for the tactician. Positionally, too, it could be quite dangerous because one can sometimes sacrifice an Elk for a light piece (knight or bishop) to achieve positional ends. There is also a variant where Scorpions take the place of the pawns (see <A HREF="scorpion.htm">Scorpion Chess</A>). Elkrider Chess can be played on a real board by using a Rook on the black squares, and turning it upside down on the white squares.

      On a black square it moves like a
      rook.
