      This solitaire game was published in Sweden, in the fifties, as &ldquo;Motti-spelet&rdquo; (Motti game). The game is known since the 19th century. In France it is called &ldquo;L&rsquo;Ane rouge&rdquo; (The red donkey), where the big square has a red colour.

      The aim is to evacuate the army corps (the big square) and save it from the onset of the surrounding enemy. To achieve this you must move it to the exit at the lower side. When positioned before the exit, win is achieved. Pieces move orthogonally to an empty square. Many solutions are possible. In the first variant it takes at least 81 moves. There are four additional variants in this implementation. One of them is insoluble. (Which?).
