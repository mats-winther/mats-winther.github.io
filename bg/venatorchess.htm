      The <I>Venator</I> is a <A HREF="bifurcation.htm">bifurcation piece.</A> It always moves in two legs. It slides orthogonally and jumps any piece to the next square, from where it slides on any of the two diagonals in the prolonged movement direction. The square behind the jumped piece must be empty and the Venator cannot stop on this square. If the Venator lacks screens for jumping, then it cannot move. The Venator is worth the same as a knight or bishop (preliminary estimate). Other rules are the same as in standard chess, except for the possible promotion to Venator. Despite the fact that the Venator is dependent on screens for moving it is a dynamic piece that puts great demands on the chessplayer. It is not hard to activate it from its initial position in the corner, although this demands planning. The Venator is a relative of the Korean cannon (in <A HREF="koreanchess.htm"  >Korean Chess</A>), which can only move if there exist pieces to jump over.

      The <B>Venator</B> (&quot;Hunter&quot;) was a gladiator type in ancient Rome that was foremostly pitted against wild animals. The board type was conceived by Gustav&nbsp;III&nbsp;of&nbsp;Sweden (1746-92) for his own chess variant <A HREF="gustaviii.htm">Gustav III&#39;s Chess.</A> Venator chess, and the new Venator piece, were invented by undersigned, September 2006.

The screens, that are used for jumping, occur anywhere on the first leg. Compare with the Koran cannon principle below.
