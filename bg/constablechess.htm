      The <I>Constable</I> moves like a nightrider, that is, it can make continuous knight-moves in the same direction. But it cannot capture in this way. Instead it captures like a queen. Its value, it seems, corresponds to rook + knight. Other rules are the same as in standard chess, except for the possible promotion to Constable. The nightrider moves gives it an extreme mobility in congested middlegame positions. As it combines mobility with the power of the queen capture, it is ideal for king-attacks in the middlegame. You can often sacrifice a light piece, &#224; la Michail&nbsp;Tal, if you can follow up the attack with a Constable. As it can only capture as a queen, and not as a knight, this piece is easier to control.

      The unusual H-shaped board makes it possible to introduce this piece without giving it undue advantage in the opening, thus avoiding monotonous opening strategies. The extra corner squares (the trenches) are exactly what the majesty has always asked for. The notorious problem of the weak first rank, and the sudden rook mate, is thereby solved. The trenches affect the strategy greatly. Boards which introduce four extra <I>diagonal</I> squares are generally not recommendable, because then the king cannot be mated by a rook. Constable chess, and the new Constable piece, were invented by undersigned, August 2006.
