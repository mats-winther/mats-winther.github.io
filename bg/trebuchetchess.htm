      The <I>Trebuchet</I> slides maximally two steps in any direction, but it cannot capture in this way. Instead the Trebuchet, when it moves, has the power to sling a piece located behind itself to a forward square in the alignment direction. The slung piece, which can be of any colour, is the nearest piece in the opposite direction of the move. This piece is hurled to the square immediately forward of the square on which the Trebuchet stops. Any enemy piece positioned here is captured. Thus the Trebuchet can be used for transporting friendly pieces, attacking enemy pieces, or removing enemy pieces from good positions. In opening and middlegame the Trebuchet introduces new tactical themes. If it remains on the first rank it can transport the rooks and the king very effectively along the first rank. In the endgame it can transport friendly pawns and the friendly king over the board. It can open files for the rooks, by removing a friendly pawn sideways. Pawns can be catapulted to their promotion square, when they are promoted to queen as only alternative. Pawns cannot be catapulted to the first rank, that is, the second rank is the limit. Kings and rooks retain their castle rights if catapulted away and back, while they haven&#39;t moved by their own accord. Other rules are the same as in standard chess, except for the possible promotion to Trebuchet. The Trebuchet&#39;s value is the same as a bishop (preliminary estimate). The movement of the Trebuchet makes an authentic impression, and is close to how Trebuchets were used in reality. Trebuchet Chess can also be played with <I>Kwaggas</I> instead of knights. Trebuchet chess, and the new Trebuchet piece, were invented by undersigned, February 2007.
