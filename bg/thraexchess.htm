      The <I>Thraex</I> is a <A HREF="bifurcation.htm">bifurcation piece.</A> It captures like a rook, but makes non-capturing moves in two legs by leaping orthogonally over an intervening piece and temporarily land on the empty square immediately behind the piece. From there it slides like a bishop on any of the two diagonals in the prolonged movement direction. The Thraex&#39;s value is 3, that is, the same as a bishop or knight (preliminary estimate). Other rules are the same as in standard chess, except for the possible promotion to Thraex. The Thraex is dependent on &#39;screens&#39; for moving, but as it can capture directly on the orthogonals it can have a positional influence also when it&#39;s unable to make non-capturing moves. Thraex chess, and the new Thraex piece, were invented by undersigned, October 2006.

      The <B>Thraex</B> was a gladiator type in ancient Rome, which was named after warriors from Thrace. The Thraex was equipped with a broad-rimmed helmet, a small round or square-shaped shield, and two thigh-length greaves. His weapon was the Thracian curved sword, or the sica.</p>

            <IMG ALT="Thraex chess piece movement" SRC="gifs/thraex1.gif" width="218" height="216" style="float:left; margin-right: 10px;">The&nbsp;Thraex&nbsp;can&nbsp;move in two legs, the first is an orthogonal slide followed by a jump, and the second is a diagonal slide. Capturing occurs orthogonally on the first leg (red = capture).

The screens, that are used for leaping, occur anywhere on the first leg. Should the screen be an enemy piece it can be captured.
