      <I>Quad</I> is a new game and the goal is to achieve four-in-a-row; a <I>quad</I> (the word &#39;quad,&#39; or &#39;quadruplet,&#39; means &quot;a combination of four of a kind&quot;). The game is played on a chess/checkers board, alternatively the smallest Go board, when the 8x8 cells are used. Diagonals don&#39;t count. Counters are dropped on the board, one by one. White must always drop the second counter on the rim (to reduce first-move advantage). After all counters have been dropped, they can move one step orthogonally in all directions. An enemy counter is captured by surrounding it with two of one&#39;s own, either horizontally or vertically (so called interception-capture). Capture is not mandatory. Similar to Go-Moku, &#39;overlines&#39; don&#39;t count (i.e., 5-in-a-row, or more). Stalemating or reducing enemy stones to zero also count as win, but this occurs very seldom. Three-times repetition of a position, with the same player to move, results in a draw.

      The dropping phase is more demanding in Quad than in <A HREF="./quint.htm">Quint,</A> since merely 4 counters in a row is enough for a win. Despite the fact that only orthogonals are used this game is quite tricky.

      The game can be played with differing amounts of counters. I have implemented versions with 12, 15, 20, and 25 counters. Possibly, it could occur that both opponents&#39; counters are reduced to less than four, but the game doesn&#39;t stop there because one could still win by way of stalemate or by removing all the opponent&#39;s counters.

      You can download my free Quad program <A HREF="Quad.zip">here</A> (updated 2005-12-19), but you must own the software <A HREF="http://www.zillions-of-games.com">Zillions of Games</A> to be able to run it.
