      The <I>Scout</I> moves like a Camelrider, and makes continuous camel-moves (3+1) in the same direction (on this board, a maximum of two). But it can only capture like a queen. The Scout has the same weakness as the bishop, namely that it can only step on squares of the same colour. But it can change square colour when capturing. Its value corresponds to rook + pawn (preliminary estimate). Other rules are the same as in standard chess, with the addition of pawn promotion to Scout.

      The Scout can, thanks to its long leaps, infiltrate the enemy position in a startling way. It can, together with a king, give mate to the enemy king. Scout Chess, and the new Scout piece, were invented by undersigned, February 2007. The Scorpion (in the extra variant) derives from my Scorpion Chess.
