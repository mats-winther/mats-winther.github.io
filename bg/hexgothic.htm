A Man steps diagonally forward. It captures by the short leap in all six directions. It must continue capturing as long as possible, and must choose the line which catches the most pieces. A Man promotes to King at the last rank. If a Man lands on a promotion square while leaping, it continues capturing as a Man. A King slides in all six directions and captures by the long leap. It must land immediately behind the captured piece and captures must be maximized. It may continue capture in the reverse direction. The goal is to capture all the enemy pieces. Two Kings against one is sufficient for a win. In an alternative variant, a Man cannot capture in the two backward directions.
