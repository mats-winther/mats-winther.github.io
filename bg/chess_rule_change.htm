<h1>Suggestions for modest changes to the chess rules</h1>
<p><br>
Historically, chess has undergone changes and developed into to the fine
game it is today. Castling, the pawn&rsquo;s double step, the long-range
bishop, and the powerful queen, have been added to perfect the game. Have
the rules now become absolutely perfect, or can we still make small
improvements? For amateurs, the complexity is good enough; but there are
signs among super-GMs that things aren&rsquo;t well, such as the current
use of tedious opening systems, and the Carlsen&nbsp;&ndash; Caruana World
Chess Championship 2018, where all games ended in a draw. We must be
prepared for a crisis of chess at high level. Kramnik has investigated nine
curious chess variants; Short has suggested abolishing stalemate; Seirawan
has proposed a variant with two extra heavy pieces. For evaluation, I here
present links to some of my proposals, which in my view are better
alternatives.</p>
