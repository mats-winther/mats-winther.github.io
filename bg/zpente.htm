      This is the same as <I>Pente</I>. To win you must get five of your stones in a row in any direction. If you place a stone so it sandwiches two opponent stones with another of your stones, the two opponent stones are captured. If you capture five pairs of your opponent&rsquo;s stones, you also win. In the tournament version, white begins with a stone in the center and black moves next. White&rsquo;s next stone must not be placed on the two nearest intersections from the center stone. This is the only difference from the standard rules.

      In 1899, Go-Moku players began experimenting with new restrictions designed to lessen the first player&rsquo;s advantage and a new name <I>Renju</I> (&ldquo;String of Pearls&rdquo;) was given to the game by Chinese poetry expert, Tenry&nbsp;Kobayashi. The first Renju federation was established in 1906 and experiments with the rules continued for the next 60 years. The <I>Ninuki-Renju</I> variant was popular in Japan from 1900-1940 and had its own organization, <I>Ninuki-Renju Sha,</I> from 1923-1940. In the U.S. it was marketed as <I>Pente,</I> with slightly different rules, beginning in the late 1970&rsquo;s. The main difference between <I>Ninuku</I> and <I>Pente</I> is that the latter allows overlines, that is, more than five stones in a row.

      Watch carefully for possibilities (for all sides) to capture pairs of opposing stones. Try to combine threats to capture your opponent&rsquo;s stones with normal Go-Moku threats such as 4-in-a-rows.
