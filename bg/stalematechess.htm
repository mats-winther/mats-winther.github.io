      The only difference between <i>Stalemate Chess</i> and regular chess is 
that stalemating the opponent wins the game, but only in case an 
enemy pawn is positioned ahead of the enemy king, on the seventh rank. <i>Stalemate is only 
a win if the king is blocked by an enemy pawn on the seventh rank.</i> 
(Thus, the stalemated party could have additional pawns and pieces on the 
board, provided that they are blocked or pinned.) This means that all non-trivial <b>K</b>&nbsp;+ 
<b>P</b> versus <b>K</b> endgames are won. However, stalemate still counts as draw in 
all other situations. Thus, many interesting qualities connected with 
stalemate are retained. Comparatively, in Chinese Chess (Xiangqi) stalemate is always a win. It is a logical enhancement of the chess rules because it merely means that we add a special capability of the pawn. Only this figure can win by stalemating on the 7th. Comparatively, only the king has the special capability of performing the castle move.
