      The <I>Grenadier</I> moves like a nightrider, that is, it can make continuous knight-moves in the same direction. But it cannot capture in this way. Instead it captures like a rook. Its value, it seems, is also that of a rook. This piece is probably new. Other rules are the same as in standard chess, except for the possible promotion to Grenadier. The nightrider moves gives it an extreme mobility in congested middlegame positions, where the rook usually is unfit. As it combines mobility with the power of the rook capture, it is ideal for king-attacks in the middlegame. As it can only capture as a rook, and not as a knight, this piece is easier to control. The Grenadier appears more powerful than a rook in opening and middlegame, because it is more active. But in the endgame the rook is probably somewhat stronger. It appears like it cannot always, together with the friendly king, give mate to the lonely enemy king.

      The unusual H-shaped board makes it possible to introduce this piece without giving it undue advantage in the opening, thus avoiding monotonous opening strategies. The extra corner squares (the trenches) are exactly what the majesty has always asked for. The notorious problem of the weak first rank, and the sudden rook mate, is thereby solved. The trenches affect the strategy greatly. Grenadier chess, and the new Grenadier piece, were invented by undersigned, August 2006.
