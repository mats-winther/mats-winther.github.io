  <P><B>Bolyar Chess is probably not authentic!</B> The material on the following link is really created by me. The author has without permission copied all my material on Bolyar Chess; text, images, including the program which he claims to have created himself. I have now removed Bolyar Chess from my own site because I have come to the conclusion that it&#39;s not an authentic historical variant. My initial information came from this web site, to which I duly linked from my own Bolyar page. I made a better presentation of the game. Now his page is useless as a reference link because it now contains only my own work. Most intriguingly, there was earlier a section about how he happened upon the material in a bookshop in London, and there was mention of the game in old letters, etc. Curiously, this description is now gone, although there is something in Bulgarian which I cannot read. On this Bulgarian site there has now appeared another historical variant, namely &quot;Abagoren Chess&quot;. But, in this case as well, there are no references in the Encyclopedia of Chess Variants or anywhere else, as far as I know. This variant, too, introduces so many strange novelties, something which makes it seem unhistorical.
