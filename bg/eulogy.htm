<P><I>She is near a farmhouse; many people in black are there. A young farm
worker digs a hole for the coffin. Out of the coffin comes an old man who
suffers the same illness as she. He absolutely wants to live. The fellow argues
with him, saying that he belongs back in there, throws him in the coffin and
shuts the lid. She herself takes no part in it and thinks: &ldquo;This has
nothing to do with me.&rdquo; In the yard stands a tree. She thinks that it is a
horse-chestnut. But it is a marvelously beautiful tree with dinner-plate sized
passion flowers which she herself had once planted. In each blossom is a little
tomato. She plucks one, eats it and knows that it is the &ldquo;cibus immortalis,&rdquo;
the food of immortality.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>Comment:</I> She said that the old man was the will to live that will
not give up, but only extends her suffering. The worker believes it is time to
die. Years later as it became harder to eat because of her illness, she said
that she wanted to eat because the will to live is generally the strongest drive
in life. She added that in Austria tomatoes are called &ldquo;paradises.&rdquo;
And tomatoes are often taken to be the &ldquo;love fruits&rdquo; from the Tree of
Knowledge. In the summer of 1994 she had this dream: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>She is working in the laundry at the cloister in Einsiedeln. She is
given to understand that Jung would come down from heaven to the wedding of the
Black Madonna. <SPAN class="nobr">Marie-Louise</SPAN> is among the one hundred elect who are permitted to
take part in the wedding. </I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>Comment:</I> She said that the unconscious was indeed preparing a remedy
for the world and a union, to be sure not one &ldquo;above in the spiritual
realm,&rdquo; but a union of above and below, a union of spirit and matter. Very
early on the <SPAN class="nobr">Virgin Mary</SPAN> was thought to be &ldquo;the earth;&rdquo;
the Black Madonna was a nature goddess. And yet the union comes about in a
Christian framework, which she <SPAN class="nobr">(Marie-Louise)</SPAN> never could accept.
But still the dream filled her with the highest happiness. Two years before she
died she dreamed that: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>She saw a tree in exquisite bloom. But it stood in water and didn&rsquo;t have
much earth around it. </I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>Comment:</I>  With the deepest earnestness she said that she wanted us
to know that one puff of wind could topple it. In August of last year she said
that she had dreamed: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>She had written an eight volume work on Arabic alchemy. She had the
eight volumes in front of her and she was quite happy about them. </I><BR></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>Comment:</I>  She understood the dream as affirming that her life&rsquo;s work
was now finished.</P>
<P>  She gave Jung as a lifetime gift, a rare Chinese frog carved from stone. He
found the gift much too precious and it was determined that this treasure be
returned to her after his death. A few weeks after his death she dreamed: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>She saw in a brook something that she took to be human <SPAN class="nobr">excrement&thinsp;&mdash;</span>&thinsp;&ldquo;something
man-made,&rdquo; she thought. As she stepped closer she saw that it was this
frog. Suddenly it lifted its foreleg and waved at her. </I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>Comment:</I>  For her, this was a sign that Jung was still living, and
she died with this frog in her hand. The frog is a symbol of resurrection. She
died on February 17, 1998, at 2:15 in the morning. A few years earlier (November
3, 1994), she dreamed:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  In an old city a new building with seventeen regular sides comprising
its perimeter had been built, a feat that was earlier considered impossible.
</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>Comment:</I>  In Arabic alchemy the seventeen-sided form meant the union
of psyche and matter, exactly what the core of her research had established.
Seventeen is as well the number of complete individuation, achieved wholeness.
