  Normal chess rules apply except for the following. By the term &#39;piece&#39; I mean all pieces, including pawns. Any pawn situated on the same file as a friendly piece, with zero or more empty squares in between, can leap forwards over the latter and land on an enemy piece standing on the same file, provided that there is just one friendly piece in between. The pawn can land on all enemy pieces on the file, but not on empty squares. However, enemy pieces positioned behind an enemy pawn cannot be reached, although the enemy pawn, in itself, can be captured. When the pawn lands it behaves like a cannon shell and &quot;explodes&quot;, that is, it is removed together with the enemy piece.

  This piece movement functions similarly as a cannon. It opens up interesting tactical and strategical possibilities during all phases of the game. One such possibilty is to exchange a pawn on the same file in order to open the file for continued attack. Pawns that fulfil the requirements for making a jump are referred to as &quot;cannons&quot;.

  Weakening the e-file in the opening by moving the pawn two steps could be dangerous, while it compromises the King&#39;s position. Despite the obvious tactical dangers, this is foremostly a calm positional game. But the risk of draw is probably lessened since opening of files for attack is facilitated.

  According to the dictionary the term &#39;gunnery&#39; refers to the use of guns; esp: the science of the flight of projectiles and of the effective use of guns. Cannon Chess was invented by undersigned, June 2006.

  <IMG ALT="Cannon Chess, example" SRC="gifs/cannon1.gif" style="float:left; margin-right:9px;">This&nbsp;is&nbsp;an&nbsp;example of opening calamity. After the moves <B>1.e4 Nc6 2.Nf3 d5</B> white made the error of playing <B>3.e5 ...</B> (diagram position). Black punishes this by <B>3...Nxe5 4.Nxe5 Be6</B> checkmate! White cannot go between with a piece because the cannon on e7 reaches the king on e1 in any case. This is a &quot;fools mate&quot; in Cannon Chess.
