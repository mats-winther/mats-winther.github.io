      The pawns are called &quot;Pitchers&quot;. They function like regular pawns with the exception of the following. When a Pitcher moves <I>one</I> step, any man standing behind it is catapulted to the square in front of the Pitcher, provided that the square is not occupied by a friendly piece. If an enemy piece is positioned here it will be captured. An enemy pawn cannot be catapulted to the first rank. A friendly pawn catapulted to the last rank is promoted to queen only. Otherwise this variant functions like regular chess.

      Paradoxically, in endgames you can sometimes block an enemy pawn by placing a piece <I>behind</I> it. The piece will be catapulted and placed in front of the enemy pawn if the pawn moves.
