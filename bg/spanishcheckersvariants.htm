    <P> Spanish checkers (<i>Damas Espanola</i>&thinsp;) denotes variants with flying King and where a Man cannot capture backwards. Nor does it continue capturing at promotion. Capture is mandatory. The board is often mirrored. In 1547, Anton&nbsp;de&nbsp;Torquemada published the first book about Spanish checkers. Variants of the game are today played all over the world; in Germany, Tanzania, Argentina, Thailand, etc. Below are described the variants that have been implemented.</p> <div style="max-width:258px; margin:auto;"><p><br>

<p><br>
<b>Spanish/Portuguese checkers</b> (8x8) (<i>Damas</i>&thinsp;)<BR>
If capturing lines are equally long, one must choose the one with the most valuable pieces, or else one must choose the longest line. Board is mirrored.
<BR><BR>
<b>Spanish II</b> (8x8) (<i>Killer Spanish</i>&thinsp;)<BR>
Same as Spanish, except that the "killer King" rule is introduced. If the last captured piece is a King, the King captor must stop at the immediate next cell after the jump. It serves to reduce the drawishness of the game, since it means that two Kings will win against a lone King. After all, in Spanish checkers, three Kings versus one is not generally won. (This Spanish variant is a suggestion of the author.)
<BR><BR>
<b>German checkers</b> (8x8) (<i>Dame/Damspiel</i>&thinsp;)<BR>
It is not mandatory to capture the longest line. 
<BR><BR>
<b>Czech checkers</b> (8x8) (<i>Dama</i>&thinsp;)<BR>

<BR><BR>
<b>Slovak checkers</b> (8x8) (<i>Dama</i>&thinsp;)<BR>

<span class="bigger">Piece movement</span>
<br><br>
		The object is to capture all your opponent&rsquo;s men by jumping over them, or
		stalemate the opponent so he has no moves. A Man can move 
		forward, by sliding diagonally to an adjacent empty square. It 
		may also jump over an enemy piece in any direction to a
		vacant square on the other side.  Jumping over a piece captures it.   
		Capturing is
		mandatory, and you must keep jumping and capturing as long as it is possible.
		<BR><BR>
		When your Man reaches the other end of the board, it becomes a King and can 
		then move and capture forwards and backwards over any distance. It also
		jumps to capture, but only one Man at a time. If a Man reaches the promotion square as part of a capture sequence, it promotes but cannot continue capturing.
