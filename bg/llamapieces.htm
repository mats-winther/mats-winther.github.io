    <blockquote>
            The Lama family of pieces jump orthogonally on every second square, but have only four capture squares. They can, however, easily change square colour by moving to the adjacent orthogonal square. Any pair of these pieces can achieve checkmate together with a king.

A peculiarity is that jumps are allowed even if it has a capture possibility on the first square.</p>
