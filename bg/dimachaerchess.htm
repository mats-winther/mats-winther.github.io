      The <I>Dimachaer</I> is a <A HREF="bifurcation.htm">bifurcation piece.</A> It moves by colliding orthogonally against any piece, and then deviating to any of the two adjacent diagonals (in the prolonged movement direction). It captures on the second leg also. Without screens to collide against the Dimachaer cannot move. The Dimachaer&#39;s value is the same as a knight (estimated). Other rules are the same as in standard chess, except for the possible promotion to Dimachaer. As it can move only by coordinating with another piece, the Dimachaer is a highly cooperative piece, something which makes it interesting to the positional player. The structure on the board decides its possibilities. The Dimachaer loses less power in the endgame than one would expect. Although screens for colliding become fewer, its scope and mobility also increases. Dimachaer Chess, and the new Dimachaer piece, were invented by undersigned, November 2006.
