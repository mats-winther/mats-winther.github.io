      In <I>Elk Chess</I> &quot;Elks&quot; take the place of the rooks. The Elk moves differently depending on the colour of the square. If positioned on a black square it moves like a Rook. If positioned on a white square it moves like a Knight. Castling is performed with an Elk instead of a Rook. The Elk&#39;s value is 4, that is, Knight + pawn, or Bishop + pawn. In regular chess the Rooks play a passive role in the first half of the game. The new Elk piece has part of the Rook&#39;s power, which can now be utilized early in the game. It is powerful enough to give mate to a lonely King.
     
      In variant &quot;Elk Chess II&quot; Elks take the place of the knights, instead.

      The elk (amer. &#39;moose&#39;) has actually been trained for battle service, in the cavalry of Charles&nbsp;XII of Sweden (1682-1718). Elks are much faster and more powerful than horses. However, it proved a time-consuming and costly task to train elks so the project was abandoned.

      The Elk is a very interesting piece for the tactician. Positionally, too, it could be quite dangerous because one can often sacrifice an Elk for a light piece (Knight or Bishop) to achieve positional ends. The Elk&#39;s image changes when it moves to a square with a different colour (it rotates). This makes it easier to understand the piece. To play this game on a regular board one can use a Rook. If the Rook is placed on a white square it is turned upside-down to show that the Elk is now moving as a Knight.

      There is also a variant where Scorpions take the place of the pawns. The Scorpion has the additional moves of a Knight, but only in two forward directions: east-north-east, and west-north-west. There are no additional capture moves. The Scorpion&#39;s value is half the value of a Knight or Bishop, that is, 1.5. This means that a light piece can be exchanged for two Scorpions, a possibility which often occurs. In the endgame it could become very dangerous, and its value often increases.
