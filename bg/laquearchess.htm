      The <I>Laquear</I> is a <A HREF="bifurcation.htm">bifurcation piece.</A> It moves by colliding diagonally against any piece, and then deviating to any of the two adjacent orthogonals (in the prolonged movement direction). But it captures like a bishop by jumping directly to the enemy piece, provided that any intermediate squares are empty. The Laquear also moves by colliding with the margin. In this case there is only one movement direction available. The Laquear&#39;s value is 3, that is, the same as bishop or knight. Other rules are the same as in standard chess, except for the possible promotion to Laquear. As it can capture by coordinating with another piece, the Laquear is a highly cooperative piece, something which makes it interesting for the positional player. The structure on the board decides its possibilities. The Laquear&#39;s capacity to collide with the margin is an important capacity. Laquear Chess can also be played with <I>Kwaggas</I> instead of knights (see <A HREF="bodyguardchess.htm">Bodyguard Chess</A>). Laquear Chess, and the new Laquear piece, were invented by undersigned, October 2006.

The screens, that are used for colliding, occur anywhere on the first leg. Should the screen be an enemy piece then it could be captured.
