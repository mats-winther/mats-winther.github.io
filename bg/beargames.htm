In this traditional form of hunt game three hunters are following a bear, trying to enclose it. Pieces can move to an adjacent intersection following the lines. The three white pieces must try to stalemate the black piece. The hunter party can always win, but it is a sophisticated game which often can take as many moves as a chess game. Neither side can capture.

  The <I>Bear game</I> (Bear hunt), is still known among elderly people in Piemonte, Italy, where it is found among rock carvings. U. Schädler has proposed that bear games could have their origin in the Roman era. This idea builds on the rectangular diagrams (see figures) that have been found in Augst, Switzerland, and which date back to the third century. These are likely to be Bear game boards, especially since they function so finely when tested. I hypothesize that the Romans viewed the board as an arena with three <I>Bestiarii</I> gladiators fighting a bear, a common spectacle in the Roman era.

  The difficulty of the game makes it a challenge to survive as long as possible with the bear. One can set a limit and say that at move forty, for instance, the hunter party must have won, otherwise the bear wins. Presumably this was how it was played, perhaps also involving betting. In this implementation white (the hunter party) only loses if position is repeated three times.

       Alternatively, the white pieces
       were initially placed on the
       positions surrounding the black
       piece.

       the program many moves to win in this
       particular variant. But it&rsquo;s easier
       for the strategical human mind.
