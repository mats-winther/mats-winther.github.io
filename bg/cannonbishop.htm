  The Crossbishop slides like a rook. But to capture it must jump over any piece and then slide like a bishop in the prolonged movement direction. The square immediately behind the jumped piece must be empty (&quot;weak&quot; Crossbishop). The Crossbishop&#39;s value is 3, that is, the same as a bishop or knight. Otherwise the rules are the same as in standard chess, except for the possible promotion to Crossbishop.
  <BR>
  <BR>
  Although the Crossbishop loses &#39;screens&#39; for jumping when the pieces become fewer, it becomes more mobile when the orthogonals are cleared from pieces. Thus it often retains its value in the endgame. Note that the Crossbishop can have a big influence from behind the friendly pawn chain, especially if it can slide along the first rank.

  <I>Crossbishop Chess,</I> and the new Crossbishop piece, were invented by undersigned, August 2006. The 68-squared Gustavian board makes it possible to place additional pieces on the board without substantially increasing the board size. This often means that a strategical and tactical intensity is maintained. It also brings the advantage that bishops and knights remain equal in value.

  There is also a variant where <A HREF="scorpion.htm">Scorpions</A> take the place of the pawns. The Scorpion has the additional moves of a Knight, but only in two forward directions: east-north-east, and west-north-west. There are no additional capture moves.The Scorpion&#39;s value is half the value of a Knight or Bishop, that is, 1.5. This means that a light piece can be exchanged for two Scorpions, a possibility which often occurs. In the endgame it could become very dangerous, and its value often increases.
