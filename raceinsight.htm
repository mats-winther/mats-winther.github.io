    <h1>Insights into the Race Issue</h1>
    <h5>We are different, after all...</h5>
    <p><i>Abstract:</i> Genetic research and statistical data have revealed pronounced racial and ethnic differences.
    It is counter-productive to sweep such facts under the carpet. The racial concept is still relevant to the
    understanding of the human condition. Since liberal-minded people tend to repress their negative feelings toward
    other ethnicities and refuse to acknowledge racial differences or problems, an unconscious <i>multicultural
    complex</i> develops. The extent to which people react with indignation when presented with sterile facts about
    race is proportionate to the strength of the unconscious complex. There exists no other remedy than to bring facts
    to light; facts which include considerable ethnic differences in IQ and upsetting interracial crime statistics.
    This is a moral burden that must be carried by each and everyone. It includes the worriment of the future prospect
    of Western culture, in view of ongoing mass immigration.<br>

    <span class="bigger">Introduction</span><br>
    <br>
    Recent research has shown that there is a genetic signal of Neanderthals in all the non-African <span class=
    "nb">genomes.&thinsp;[<a href="#n1">1</a>]</span> As a consequence the traditional out-of-Africa theory, which was
    regarded as the foremost anti-race theory, has become obsolete. The introduction of Neanderthal genes could provide
    an explanation for the larger brain of non-Africans. Neanderthals had a significantly larger brain than Sapiens.
    (It could have been as much as 20% larger.) This question has already arisen in earlier research (&lsquo;Could our
    big brains come from <span class="nb">Neanderthals?&rsquo;.&thinsp;[<a href="#n2">2</a>])</span><br>
    <br>
    Even outside the realm of genetics, notions of ethnic differences are again topical. Today there exist racially
    targeted pharmaceuticals. In biomedical studies, responses to medical therapies, such as drugs, are often compared
    among populations divided according to traditional racial divisions. Although it is inadvisable to focus narrow-mindedly
    on race, due to the import of cultural and environmental factors and natural genetic disparity,
    &lsquo;race-neutral&rsquo; studies have been found to fail ethnic minorities who respond differently to
    medication.<br>
    <br>
    It is becoming more and more apparent that we are, after all, different. In the statistics that compare ethnicities
    we find different degrees of aggressiveness and IQ. Such differences were earlier believed to originate solely from
    environmental factors, such as poverty. Today, we are forced to acknowledge that such quite pronounced differences
    might depend on race, after all. Below statistical figures show that the concept of race is still pertinent. Life
    would have been easier if racial issues didn&rsquo;t exist; but they do, quite by themselves, and whether we like it or
    not.<br>
    <br>
    <span class="bigger">Surreptitious racism</span><br>
    <br>
    The race question mustn&rsquo;t be swept under the carpet. One ought to clear the air sometimes and not lock every
    painful problem into airtight compartments. If hypocrisy goes too far, people become neurotic, bending over
    backwards just to avoid mentioning race. This sometimes creates more interpersonal problems than it solves, says
    the author of the following article: &lsquo;Seeing Race and Seeming <span class=
    "nb">Racist?&rsquo;&thinsp;[<a href="#n3">3</a>].</span> Moreover, it&rsquo;s the constant, vague,
    just-below-the-surface acts of racism that impair performance, day in and day out. This form of surreptitious
    racism magnifies when people remain politically correct and refuse to talk openly about painful questions (see
    &lsquo;Racism&rsquo;s Cognitive Toll: Subtle Discrimination Is More Taxing On The <span class=
    "nb">Brain&rsquo;&thinsp;[<a href="#n4">4</a>]).</span> Accordingly, it&rsquo;s better to talk more openly about
    race.<br>
    <br>
    The question of <i>unconscious racism</i> is pertinent to this. At Uppsala university, Sweden, an experiment was
    set up where people watched crime scenes on <span class="nb">film.&thinsp;[<a href="#n5">5</a>]</span> Women were
    much more prone to misjudge the scene and identify the immigrant as perpetrator. The researcher said that this was
    due to the fact that women tend to be much more liberal than men in matters of immigration. So, they repressed
    their negative feelings for immigrants, which caused them to point them out as perpetrators, instead. This is the
    treacherous way in which the unconscious works. The conclusion is that a multiculturalist person is likely to be
    unconsciously racist, due to repressed negative feeling, whereas a person who thinks critically in terms of
    ethnicity and race is prone to point out the correct perpetrator, in this experiment the white person.<br>
    <br>
    <span class="bigger">Statistics on IQ</span><br>
    <br>
    Some say that race isn&rsquo;t significant, but that poverty alone can explain the differences in criminal
    violence. But what if poverty depends on race? The races do have different distributions of brain size and
    intelligence quotient (IQ). Blacks have a lower average IQ and smaller average brain size relative to bodily
    volume. The differences are significant and substantial. Blacks in the U.S. (who have about 20% White admixture),
    the Caribbean, Britain, and Canada, average IQs of about 85. The lowest average IQs, Philippe&nbsp;Rushton says,
    are found for sub-Saharan Africans, from 70 to <span class="nb">75.&thinsp;[<a href="#n6">6</a>]</span> According
    to Kanazawa, however, it is as low as 63 in Ethiopia, which is the world&rsquo;s lowest. (If correct, this is
    surprisingly low.)<br>
    <br>
    Satoshi&nbsp;Kanazawa, an evolutionary psychologist, has published research which concludes that low IQ levels,
    rather than poverty and disease, is the reason why African life expectancy is low and infant mortality high. His
    paper, published in the British Journal of Health Psychology, compares IQ scores with indicators of ill health in
    126 countries and claims that nations at the top of the ill health league also have the lowest intelligence
    <span class="nb">ratings.&thinsp;[<a href="#n7">7</a>]</span> A similar argument is provided by Richard&nbsp;Lynn
    and Tatu&nbsp;Vanhanen. In <i>IQ and the Wealth of Nations</i> (2002) they argue that differences in national
    income per capita correlate with differences in the average national <span class="nb">IQ.&thinsp;[<a href=
    "#n8">8</a>]</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="bigger">Statistics on crime</span><br>
    <br>
    The U.S. Department of Justice report, <i>Criminal Victimization in the United States</i>, 2005, provides us with
    daunting crime <span class="nb">statistics.&thinsp;[<a href="#n9">9</a>]</span> From that year&rsquo;s report I
    calculate that Blacks are an estimated 50 times more likely to commit violent crime against a White than vice
    versa, and 167 times more likely to commit interracial robbery. (Especially the latter figure would vary much
    between the years due to the scarcity of White on Black robbery). According to Table 42, black men committed 37,461
    sexual assaults/rapes of white women compared to statistically zero (less than 10) White on Black. Keep in mind
    that the reported rape figures are believed to represent less than half, probably only ca. 37-38% of the real
    number.<br>
    <br>
    &bull; Total sexual assaults/rapes of white women: 111,490<br>
    <br>
    &bull; White offender and white victim: 44.5% or 49,613<br>
    <br>
    &bull; Black offender and white victim: 33.6% or 37,461<br>
    <br>
    &bull; Other (or unknown) offender and white victim: 21.9% or 24,416<br>
    <br>
    &bull; Total sexual assaults/rapes of black women: 36,620<br>
    <br>
    &bull; Black offender and black victim: 100% for 36,620<br>
    <br>
    &bull; White (or other) offender and black victim: 0% for 0<br>
    <br>
    Although black men make up only 12.4% of the male population, in 2005 they committed 33.6% of the rapes of white
    women and 100% of the rapes of black women. This amounts to 50% of total rapes, which means that black men are
    hugely over-represented as rape assailants (see Table 42). As for interracial rapes, the imbalance is even worse.
    It&rsquo;s off the charts because there were a chocking 37,461 rapes of white women by black men and less than 10
    rapes of black women by white men. It&rsquo;s not possible to calculate the imbalance because the disproportion is
    too big, and White on Black is statistically zero.<br>
    <br>
    Assuming that white men make up 75% of the male population, a black man is almost 9 times more likely to commit a
    rape than a white man (regardless of race of victim, see Table 40), and they account for virtually all the rapes of
    black women. This is not only a problem in the States. More than 25% of South African men questioned in a survey
    published by the Medical Research Council (MRC) in June 2009 admitted to raping someone; of those, nearly half said
    they had raped more than one <span class="nb">person.&thinsp;[<a href="#n10">10</a>]</span> Blacks also commit
    robbery at a very high disproportion, including the vast majority of all robberies committed against Blacks. The
    likelihood for a black person committing robbery is probably even higher than that for rape, but figures are more
    uncertain due to the many cases with unknown race of offender (see Table 40).<br>
    <br>
    Economic status can&rsquo;t explain the extent of the racial imbalance in crime rates. The percentage of Blacks
    living in poverty is higher than that of Whites. Still, there are more Whites living below the poverty line than
    Blacks. According to the 2004 Census data, the Black poverty rate was 24.7% while the White poverty rate was
    <span class="nb">8.6%.&thinsp;[<a href="#n11">11</a>]</span> From a poverty perspective, one would expect the per
    capita crime rate for Blacks to be higher than that of Whites, but the total number of crimes committed ought to be
    much lower than the White number.<br>
    <br>
    Obviously, if one believes that poverty generates crime, such as rape, poverty doesn&rsquo;t even begin to explain
    it. In the U.S., there were approximately 10.0 million white males and 4.7 million black males living in poverty in
    2005. Although there were twice as many poor Whites than Blacks, it is not mirrored in the crime statistics. Even
    if normalized for economic status, the disproportion of interracial rapes remains colossally high. Interracial
    robbery is equally disproportionate, and other violent crimes are also disproportionate but to a lesser extent.<br>
    <br>
    <span class="bigger">Discussion</span><br>
    <br>
    What I am referring to in this article are facts from research. Personally, I am not good at measuring status, nor
    am I prone to judge people according to any form of surreptitious status differential. Because this statistic is
    hurtful to read, I expect people to carry a bit of moral pain together with the victims, their parents and spouses,
    and not to dismiss the whole issue as racist. In the present day, many people seem to abandon their heart while
    giving preference to the ideological intellect, saturated with liberalist, multiculturalist, and relativist
    ideology.<br>
    <br>
    Both the FBI Uniform Crime Report and the American Justice Department lay bare the same thing; the incidence of
    Black on White violent crime is several times greater than White on Black violent crime in all categories,
    especially rape and robbery. Such facts mustn&rsquo;t be swept under the carpet, because people will continue
    talking about it secretly, which is worse in the long run. Many people will tend to ignore such inconvenient facts
    as they are afraid of being branded as racists. This is cowardice. Rape victims become even more humiliated when
    their human value is downgraded by not being properly acknowledged.<br>
    <br>
    The enormously disproportionate incidence of Black interracial crime is real and it should become public knowledge.
    The mainstream press is deliberately hiding this inconvenient information. Instead, they tend to sensationalize
    whatever White on Black rape they can find, such as the Duke&nbsp;Lacrosse <span class="nobr">case&thinsp;[<a href=
    "#n12">12</a>]</span> and the Tawana&nbsp;Brawley <span class="nobr">case,&thinsp;[<a href="#n13">13</a>]</span>
    both of which turned out to be hoaxes. The consequence of hypocrisy is that the psychic split is widening in the
    collective mind, between a civilized politically correct consciousness and an instinctual emotional unconscious.
    People tend to abandon their heart more and more, preferring to live according to their ideologically programmed
    brain. To remedy this, the only way is to accept painful reality.<br>
    <br>
    <span class="bigger">The Other</span><br>
    <br>
    It is reasonable to question whether interracial crime statistics have any relevance as compared to overall
    statistics. Our rational everyday mind tells us that we should take lightly to such peripheral things as
    interracial crime statistics. However, unconsciously, people don&rsquo;t take it lightly. We remain instinctual
    creatures, and all kinds of fears obtain in the unconscious. The darker side of ourselves is easily stirred. I am
    certain that the same figures would upset many people if they were reversed. All the multiculturalists would
    condemn, in every public media, the cruelty and oppression in the hands of white people. Evidently, in repressing
    the racial issue, we have created a collective psychological problem. If hypocrisy goes too far, people will become
    neurotic, bending over backwards just to avoid mentioning race.<br>
    <br>
    In South Africa white women can no longer travel alone by train. Formerly, black women could travel by train,
    although they had to sit in certain places, which created an uproar. Yet, when white women cannot travel at all,
    nobody even mentions it. In South Africa, by 2010, over 3200 white farmers had been murdered in politically
    motivated violence since apartheid rule ended in <span class="nb">1994.&thinsp;[<a href="#n14">14</a>]</span> It
    seems as if there is an enormous tolerance of racialist murders and apartheid as long as it is the white race that
    suffers. Unconsciousness creates a hypocritical double-sided personality. To remedy this, it is necessary to
    &ldquo;clean the inside of the cup&rdquo; by remaining conscious of evil, including the evils of the black
    race.<br>
    <br>
    What&rsquo;s behind the intolerance of racial differences and the denial of painful facts? As many a psychoanalyst
    has observed, many neurotic people today cannot accept <i>otherness.</i> There can only be likeness and unity. If
    other people are going to be accepted, they must march under the same banner, and their ideas must coincide with
    one&rsquo;s own. Otherwise, the feeble ego is offended. The existence of the <i>Other</i> is experienced as a
    potential threat; a questioning and a denial of the weak ego. If that&rsquo;s the case, the Other will soon be
    subjected to harassment and shut out. In the worst historical examples, the scapegoats were imprisoned in
    extermination camps. In accordance with the current sameness ideology, it is not possible to accept &ldquo;the
    Negro&rdquo; as Other, because that would necessitate apartheid.<br>
    <br>
    The outsider is to be reintroduced into collective identification under the banner: &ldquo;There is only One people
    and One human fellowship. No other races or diverging individuals exist, nor have they the right to exist. <i>In
    that case they must be removed.</i>&rdquo; The ideology of <i>racial homogenization</i> is a notorious and
    agonizing phenomenon that keeps returning in history in many different forms. Today, the Other is typically accused
    of having &ldquo;undemocratic&rdquo; and racialist views.<br>
    <br>
    <span class="bigger">What to do about it?</span><br>
    <br>
    It&rsquo;s not always necessary to take action. It is, in itself, wholesome to remain conscious of the shadowy side
    of existence. In this way, personality helps carry the load of suffering people. Otherwise, a hypocritical
    personality is created whose outside is clean and politically correct, while the unconscious side is rotting up.
    Already Jesus identified this problem (Matt. 23:25-28). If we can&rsquo;t ventilate painful issues such as these,
    in what forum can we take issue with them? The answer is that it ends up in the unconscious, forming an unconscious
    complex. The extent to which people recoil in denial and politically correct outrage when presented with such sterile
    facts, accusing the messenger of racism, is proportionate to the strength of the unconscious complex. The
    <i>multicultural complex</i> is real, as demonstrated in the Uppsala research referenced above. Unconscious
    complexes cause all forms of disturbances, from stomach upsets to severe psychological symptoms, such as pointing
    out the wrong person from the witness stand.<br>
    <br>
    Lynn &amp; Vanhanen have found that national income per capita correlates with average national <span class=
    "nb">IQ.&thinsp;[<a href="#n8">8</a>]</span> This means that a general lowering of IQ, as a consequence of
    immigration, will impact the overall technological and economical qualification of a country in the future. It will
    scale down the standard of culture, and it will become more naive. Today, the youth prefer rap music,
    whereas they hardly listen to classical music anymore. Today&rsquo;s average IQ in the U.S. is 98. In Mexico
    it&rsquo;s 87. Accordingly, a continued Mexican immigration will contribute to a lower average IQ. As a result, a
    greater portion of the population will require unqualified jobs. Meanwhile, government policy tries to increase the
    level of education and create a more qualified labour market. The consequence is that society will become more and
    more economically segregated, which is bound to increase crime rates.<br>
    <br>
    It&rsquo;s necessary to comprehend what&rsquo;s under way in our times, for us to take responsibility for future
    generations. Current developments are bound to generate problems that in turn will cause sleep disturbance and
    other symptoms in the population. Especially, psychotherapists should <i>keep conscious</i> of problems in our time
    that generate unconscious symptoms in patients. Accordingly, psychological authors are today discussing notions of
    ethnic psychology. <span class="nobr">Donald R. Atkinson</span> focuses on counseling ethnic and racial minorities
    and identifies characteristics unique to each group. <span class="nobr">Joseph Henderson</span> has advanced the
    notion of a &ldquo;cultural unconscious&rdquo;. <span class="nobr">Michael V. Adams</span> discusses unconscious
    racial and ethnic factors (collective attitudes and behaviors that are really ethnic factors).<br>
    <br>
    Literature is growing because it is necessary to relate to <i>reality</i>, leaving behind the puerile worldview
    building on airy-fairy ideology. It is a way of thinking that people have typically adopted in their youth; an
    ideal world of all-encompassing motherly reliance, a place where human nature is inherently good. But such ideas
    are really predicated on the mother complex. I have elsewhere argued that culture is very much determined by, and
    highly dependent on, the constitutional collective character of its <span class="nb">population.&thinsp;[<a href=
    "#n15">15</a>]</span> I express my concern that the ongoing mix of ethnic groups in the West forebodes a cultural
    regression in the motherly, matriarchal, direction.<br>
    <br>
    <span class="bigger">The Arabic reversal</span><br>
    <br>
    A striking historical example of a regress is what underwent in the Arab world. Arab civilization made great
    advances in learning and culture up to a certain point in the Middle Ages. Suddenly it ran out of steam and lost
    its vitality; an occurrence which allowed room for European expansion. Historians have been puzzled by this
    reversal. Recently, genetic research has revealed that sub-Saharan Africans have contributed greatly to the genome
    of today&rsquo;s Arab <span class="nb">population.&thinsp;[<a href="#n16">16</a>]</span> The Arabs imported
    enormous numbers of African female slaves, a trade that ended only in the late 19th century. Contrary to America,
    Arab countries imported predominantly women slaves. Estimates by historians suggest the extent of the Arab slave
    trade to between 11 to 25 million black Africans, and from thousands to in excess of one million <span class=
    "nb">Europeans.&thinsp;[<a href="#n17">17</a>]</span> The female slaves were exploited sexually (Arab men viewed
    the womb only as the vessel that their seed grew in). Yet, unlike in America, there are no direct descendants of
    the slaves in the Arab world. This is because Arabs, as a whole, are descendants of African slaves. The African
    genome was swallowed up by the Arab population.<br>
    <br>
    The mixing of the two races that occurred rapidly during medieval times could, I suggest, explain the mysterious
    cultural reversal that took place in the Arab world. The Arabic population had at a point in time inherited so much
    of sub-Saharan African traits that it affected the vitality of a whole civilization. The genetic shift took place
    very rapidly. A thousand years ago the Arabs had little or no African markers in their genome. In medieval times
    the genome changed rapidly. Why should not such a rapid change have affected culture? I theorize that it has
    clearly affected average IQ, which is around 83 in today&rsquo;s Arab <span class="nb">countries.&thinsp;[<a href=
    "#n8">8</a>]</span><br>
    <br>
    We balk at notions of racial purity, especially in light of the overblown pseudo-scientific ideas of the thirties.
    Nevertheless, it might be necessary to tackle this problem, while keeping it within the limits of the sane. We must
    bring to light to what extent our advanced Western civilization depends on our inherited genetic makeup, and
    whether African/Arabic immigration, primarily, may generate a devitalization on lines of the Arabic reversal. The
    13th century Mongol invasion is part of the explanation for the decline in economics and culture (libraries were
    burnt), but it cannot explain the change in collective psychology. After all, Europe has also suffered Mongol
    invasions. Arabic culture lost all vitality and the Arabs became a backward people. It is a very surprising turn of
    events. Normally, a high culture would keep up its resolve and be fixed on rebuilding itself. In a sense, an
    invasion may strengthen a high culture, considering that individuals tend to become more determined and prepared to
    make self-sacrifice for a larger purpose. The massive introduction of sub-Saharan African genes would have played a
    greater role than the Mongol invasion. (Since I wrote this, I have discovered that Donald&nbsp;I.&nbsp;Templer
    discusses these problems in Mankind Quarterly, <span class="nb">2010.&thinsp;[<a href="#n18">18</a>])</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="bigger">Unconscious racism</span><br>
    <br>
    People do not only worry about the future well-being of their sons and daughters. What is gnawing in their
    unconscious is an anxiety about the ongoing undermining of culture, the future prospects of their country and
    civilization. Such worries cause nervous problems, sleeplessness, and stomach upsets. It is a mad idea of our
    times that people ought to cast off their sense of responsibility for, and feeling for, their own genetic kinship
    and the cultural values of their country. It is the responsibility of intellectuals to develop an understanding of
    human nature and to keep conscious of the shadowy side of existence. The unconscious always incorporates that which is
    intolerable to present-day consciousness. It is the responsibility of psychoanalysts and debaters to understand why
    white Americans create &ldquo;gated communities&rdquo; to hold the black population at bay. After all, what is the
    probability that hordes of Blacks will leave the Chicago ghetto and invade the suburban communities? The gated
    community seems like an idea fetched from the thirties, building on racial purity and the genetic superiority of
    the propertied classes.<br>
    <br>
    Instead of taking exaggerated measures resulting in severe segregation, inflated prejudice, and collective
    paranoia, we must talk about the collective complex that generates anxiety. It is a well-known psychological
    insight that conscious realization serves to resolve complexes. It allows consciousness to carry the problem
    instead. One such problem is &ldquo;race&rdquo;. There is no way around it. White people should realize the
    underlying reasons for their unconscious negative feelings toward Blacks. This is better than enclosing themselves
    in Aryan gated communities while maintaining their hypocritical liberal-minded view that race doesn&rsquo;t
    exist.<br>
    <br>
    &ldquo;Race&rdquo; continues to exist regardless of the fact that intellectuals have declared the concept obsolete.
    It exists in people&rsquo;s unconscious. White Americans often dream about Negroes, as psychologist C.&#8239;G.&nbsp;Jung 
	has noted. (People dream about gods and angels, too, regardless of what Richard&nbsp;Dawkins says.) &ldquo;Race&rdquo; is
    a very charged notion. Most animals have an instinctual fear of strangers of the same species. They chase strangers
    away, and sometimes even kill them. Humans have this unconscious archetypal fear of strangers, too. That&rsquo;s
    why we have to deal with this topic, and remain conscious of the problem. We should not denounce people who raise
    the issue, calling them &ldquo;racists&rdquo; and &ldquo;bigots&rdquo;. Seeing the diverse ethnicities and races as
    they truly are means that they are saved from something much worse. At heart, all people want to be accepted as
    they are. Black people, as a group, are not adequate to the demands of white civilization. Yet, they managed well in
    the African Bantu culture, building an ecologically sustainable civilization. To both the teacher and pupils of a black
    class, it would be a great relief if they weren&rsquo;t expected to get the same results as a white class. A stone
    would fall from their shoulders.<br>
    <br>
    People in the modern world must learn to relate to controversial facts instead of sweeping them under the carpet.
    Psychic <i>repression</i> is an antiquated means of relating to reality that is out of place in the modern world.
    As a consequence, the unconscious becomes chock-full of putrid content, generating vulgar and neurotic
    compensations. In a complex world we should be able to put a load on our conscious faculty and carry a bit of moral
    pain. Modern people, generally speaking, should be capable of this due to a stronger ego consciousness. We are
    better equipped to understand reality. It is high time to challenge this attitude of moral indolence. We
    needn&rsquo;t always repress every uncomfortable fact. We would better deal with the problems <i>consciously</i>,
    which would avoid much suffering, regardless of race. It leads to a better acceptance of differences, and better
    understanding of racial nature in public consciousness. When the trolls are dragged into the daylight they explode.
    Complexes will turn into conscious problems that can be dealt with, vexatious as they are, whereas surreptitious
    racism and psychological oppression would soon abate. Let&rsquo;s swallow the bitter pill, and paranoia and
    unfounded elitism will lose much of their momentum. A strengthening of consciousness means becoming vaccinated
    against exaggerations.<br>
    <br>
    <span class="bigger">Conclusion</span><br>
    <br>
    It is becoming more and more evident that we are experiencing an awakening of racial consciousness. These findings
    mustn&rsquo;t be allowed to metamorphose into vulgar forms of racialism and nationalism, as in earlier history.
    Only by allowing room to such facts in public consciousness, there to be interpreted correctly, can
    misinterpretations of vulgar nature be avoided. We mustn&rsquo;t allow racial insights to be the sole property of
    people belonging to fringe political groups, who are bound to distort and exaggerate facts. This should be evident
    to people that think in psychoanalytic terms, but is yet to be understood by the average journalist or
    debater, who always thinks that repression of disagreeable facts is the great panacea for every problem in human
    affairs. There are considerable differences between the races. &ldquo;Racism&rdquo;, from a psychological perspective, 
	is when you make expression of negative <i>attitudes</i> and <i>behaviour</i> towards people of another race. 
	So, you are not a racist if you think that the races are different. Nor are you a sexist if you think that men and 
	women are different.
