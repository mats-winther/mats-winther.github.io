<h1>The Spiritual and the Psychic: About Differentiation of Values in Scripture and Theology</h1>

<P><I>Abstract:</I></P>

<P>
In paintings and in our imagination, the Trinity is portrayed as three individuals of our own species. Augustine thought it was awkward, but realized that we had to live with the concept of the divine "person" (). In truth, God is spirit and not a "thing". He dwells not in time and space, nor does he reside in a certain place called "heaven". Nevertheless, we need such images in order to make sense of religion in narrative terms. We resort to worldly images to satisfy our naive side, including our feelings. These are mere "analogies", as Aquinas explains (). The devil, likewise, represents an attempt to make sense of evil in the guise of a mythic personality. 
<br><br>
Although evil is analyzed by Augustine as the absence of good, which means that evil is <i>nihil</i>, he somewhat inconsequently discusses the Evil One as a metaphysical manifestation of evil. According to Augustine himself, thoroughly evil things or persons cannot exist, because evil is equal to lack of being. So why does he reason about this "Manichaean" symbol of evil? It's because his sophisticated theory of evil as <i>privatio boni</i> can merely satisfy our intellect. To our feelings and instincts it doesn't mean much. Our psychological, instinctual, and emotional side needs something more substantial in order to come to grips with the traumas of life. (SciAm)
<br><br>
That's why we have created both sophisticated theology and naive narratives, and both are necessary. The problem is that it's all jumbled up. We need to better separate theology from mythology. Theology is intellectual and should be taken seriously while mythology is psychological, has another kind of reality-status, and ought to be taken less seriously. In the present time, atheists like Richard&nbsp;Dawkins and Sam&nbsp;Harris attack the narratives of religion only. After all, they have no grasp of theology. They wrongly claim that religion is <i>nothing but</i> naive and unscientific fairy tale. They are correct in so far as there is no "God-thing", no bearded old man sitting on a throne in a place called heaven. This is a naive picture we relate to children, because they aren't ready for intellectual theology. So atheists are really attacking a strawman, because theologians have long since presented an intellectual alternative to the religious narratives. It's a case of barking up the wrong tree. 
<br><br>
Modern atheists are only repeating the arguments of bygone days. Xenophanes and other pre-Socratic philosophers began questioning the myths of the gods and saw them as ridiculous and immoral (https://www.iep.utm.edu/greekphi/). Among many an intellectual in ancient Greece, the stories of the gods weren't taken seriously anymore. Certain of the Sophists were atheists or agnostics. In order to counter the growing atheism of his times, Plato endeavoured to formulate a philosophy of the divine. 
<br><br>
Science tries to determine what is metaphysically true in material reality whereas theology attempts to establish what is divine truth, and the two disciplines probably overlap. Religious narrative, however, revolves around <i>psychic</i> reality. It has not the same reality-status, although it can have a strong impact. It's about morals, feelings, a sense of inner meaning, and a way of narrating one's experiences so that they can be contained in memory, and thus prevented from causing anxiety. As long as we have narratives, which could be of the fairy tale kind, we can heal the confusion in our soul and get a sense of psychic meaning. That's why the dream function creates narratives all the time; to maintain a healthy psyche. 
<br><br>
As long as we lack scientific understanding, it is necessary to make sense of events with the aid of narratives. Historically, this has come to expression as tales of gods and demons. Research finds that we involuntarity create narratives to explain our experiences, although our hasty conclusions do not necessarily coincide with the actual event-chain (). In fact, even when we have a fine theoretical understanding, it might be necessary to understand things symbolically anyway, because dry theory cannot always satisfy our soul. The problem of evil is an obvious example. 
<br><br>
Evidently, the theology of evil (Augustine's <i>privatio boni</i>) belongs to another category than the story of the angelic fall. The latter is religious narrative and has not the same truth-value as augustinian theology. Nevertheless, mythology remains part and parcel of religion and has great psychological value. Theology speaks primarily to the minor part of our psyche that is conscious and rational. However, also our unconscious side searches for an explanation of reality in a language that it can understand. It consists mostly of images rather than abstractions. Myth can satisfy our animistic unconscious.
<br><br>
The conclusion is that myth cannot serve as an infallible source of theological and philosophical eductions, as they represent different kinds of reality, or different kinds of truth. Religious myth must not be viewed as perfectly truthful and fully translatable to intellectual discourse. It is directed at an irrational side of ourselves that is enlightened by feelings and intuitions. The biblical creation story is a case in point. A correct translation from the biblical Hebrew of Genesis 1:1 should probably read something like this:</p>

<blockquote>When in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth, the earth was untamed and shapeless.</blockquote>

<p>So God shaped the world out of a chaotic substance which was there before him (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genesis_creation_narrative). This was the common story among the creation myths of the era. Alternatively, the creator god defeats the chaos monster and shapes the world out of his/her bodily parts, as in the Babylonian Enuma&nbsp;Elish, where Marduk defeats the chaos monster Tiamat. God also creates Adam out of dust, and Eve from a rib of Adam. Later, God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife. So he is depicted as a <i>deus faber</i>, a craftsman god. From a theological and scientific perspective, the biblical creation story gives the wrong picture. According to both Augustine and modern science, creation was <i>ex nihilo</i>. This is why Genesis&nbsp;1:1 has been "corrected". 
<br><br>
This shows that we must not overestimate religious myth, nor should we see it as historical and literal truth. The theology of rational consciousness must dominate in religion, whereas myth should play second fiddle. However, this doesn't mean that it lacks value, as such, and that's why Rudolf&nbsp;Bultmann's call to <i>demythologization</i> is not such a good idea. Although Bultmann appreciates the value of religious myth, he thinks that the valuable content of myth is wholly translatable to dialectical theology and philosophical existentialism. But we mustn't eliminate mythology this way, since it speaks to the feeling side of ourselves, something which philosophy and theology cannot do. 
<br><br>
Although it is worthwhile to discuss mythic content in theological and philosophical terms, we cannot expect to extract the whole truth and translate it to rational language. Myth, dream and fairy tale can and should be interpreted, but they are standalone psychic products which must also remain as they are. Mythology is not simply rational truths conveyed in metaphorical language. Rather, it fulfils a function in that it speaks to our feelings, aesthetic side, sense of wonder, and unconscious religious instinct. All this is essential to religion, regardless of the theological truth-value of the myth.
<br><br>
Bultmann saw biblical myth as anachronistic, such as the three-storied universe (heaven&ndash;earth&ndash;hell), or the evil spirits driven out by Jesus and the wonders he performs. Such stories could repel modern people from their commitment to the Christian message. This is a correct conclusion, but it has become an impediment only because we overestimate these stories. We may instead look at biblical mythology with the same frame of mind as when watching a film, such as  Ingmar&nbsp;Bergman's <i>The Seventh Seal</i>. He didn't think anybody would take it seriously, because it was so fabulous and unrealistic. It turned out that the viewers took it seriously, even when the Grim&nbsp;Reaper is playing chess with the knight Antonius&nbsp;Block, and the film is today regarded as a masterpiece of cinema. 
<br><br>
People have two sides to their psychology. The first is scientific and theological; the second is imaginary, allegorical, fanciful. Stories connect with the latter side. They may give rise to a sense of awe, activate feelings of fascination, and stir up something in the unconscious. Viewers seem to take the story about the Grim&nbsp;Reaper seriously, because they emotionally identify with the film actors. At the same time they realize that he isn't real. But it doesn't matter to them. It's because, unlike abstract theological and scientific discourse, such a story has an immediate impact on people's feelings.
<br><br>
How about the biblical story of Jonah, who spent three days and three nights in the belly of a fish? Must it be demythologized, or can we enjoy this good story in the same way we enjoy Bergman's film? Jonah's reemergence from the belly of the fish calls to mind the resurrection of the Christ. Although it has a certain theological value, it is pure narrative and mustn't be overestimated. The psychic value predominates. 
<br><br>
The Jungian school of psychology relies on psychic truth-value as sole measure. If something is not psychologically enticing, then it has not much value. It is alleged that science and theology produce only provisional theories about a <i>noumenal</i> reality that is forever indeterminable (). Christianity is evaluated as decrepit and dispirited, and thus it has not much value for people, as long as it isn't radically reformed. But is the Christian message false only because the people in the pew have become apathetic? Is the mathemathics which is taught in the classroom false only because the pupils are bored? Of course, not! It seems that we must reckon with two kinds of truth-value; on the one hand the theological/scientific and on the other the psychic. A theological or scientific paper may be dull and cumbersome, but could be perfectly true anyway. Per contra, romantic love isn't real in the same way as matter or divinity is real; but it's real enough for the parties involved. It's <i>everything</i> to them. This is a kind of argument that Jung makes again and again. In the following diagram, the y-axis represents theological or scientific truth-value whereas the x-axis represents psychic truth-value.</p>

In the diagram, (A) could be a theological dissertation that is quite cogent but uninspiring for the soul. (B) could be a commonplace story told at the workplace. (C) is perhaps the Book of Jonah. (D) could be a very good film or novel, from which one could not draw much intellectual nourishment. (E) would be the Christian <i>kerygma</i>. What about the gold nuggets of the synoptic Gospels, the parables of Jesus? Where shall we put them in the diagram? In my view, we mustn't overestimate their theological value. They are mostly psychological, aiming to circumvent the intellect and make the reader wonder. Thus, we know that we cannot translate them to theological or philosophical theses. We cannot empty them of content, for they are designed to be psychic narratives that shall serve to inspire the reader.

The problem is that 

the devil is taken too seriously

Christianity is twofold: it is theology and myth.

Why didn't Jesus return, as Paul expected? Because it was myth. It represents a longing for his return. It's psychic.

Depletion of the psychic

If your kid asks for help with their mental health, please send them to a therapist. Don’t tell them to go to the pastor or pray more. Get them professional help. I went through years of depression, self harm, and eating disorders, all because my mom just kept telling me to go to my pastor.

Fr. Victor White realized that the psychic must be introduced in Christianity. But Jung thought that only the psychic exists, and the spirit has no relevance (the spirit was psychic to him).

St Augustine, the First Western Psychologist

The impending return of Jesus Christ is a psychic truth, in itself. "the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night."
