<H5 style="color:#383838;">On inferior psychology and religion</H5>
<P>Everything that king Midas touched turned into gold. The modern collective
spirit has brought forth a counterpart; a personality capable of transforming
any genuine subject matter into plastic. While the want of spiritual bread is immense,
the very people responsible for providing it tragically fail to satisfy the
need. Instead they provide a surrogate. Maria&nbsp;Bergom&nbsp;Larsson (1995) recounts an ominous dream:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I dreamt that the nuclear war had started. The world was on fire
and buildings collapsed around me. In the middle of the catastrophe people stood
in line before the celeb clergyman Lennart&nbsp;Koskinen to partake of the Communion.
But the sacramental bread dealt out by the clergyman looked like GB&nbsp;Sandwich [an ice cream with bread] and it was made of plastic. (Bergom&nbsp;Larsson, 1995, <i>my transl.</i>)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The tragic dimension of the above dream is obvious. There is a synonymous
phenomenon which I want to put my finger on. In America, especially, has
appeared a brand of &ldquo;plastic&rdquo; psychologists who deal out a surrogate
bread, wholly lacking in sustenance. Although this is done in the name of Jungian
psychology, it belies the legacy of the pioneers and has nearly succeeded in
turning their principles into the opposite standpoint. I am thinking of
psychologists like Hillman, Romanyshyn and
Vannoy&nbsp;Adams whose theories go under names like &ldquo;phenomenological&rdquo;
or &ldquo;archetypal&rdquo;. Surprisingly, this branch is allowed to expand its
territory without drawing much fire from dissentient theorists. But it&rsquo;s 
high time to take this &ldquo;plasticizing&rdquo; psychology properly to task.</P>
<P>The aforementioned psychologists&rsquo; fundamental tenet is to &ldquo;stick to the
image&rdquo;. Such an attitude results in superficiality and delusiveness. This
inescapably follows from the call to keep to the surface of things. Whereas
traditional Jungian psychology emphasizes moral commitment, this school
elevates fantasy and gives it an unwarranted position. Marilyn&nbsp;Nagy
is uneasy about this development:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The role of imagination and the function of the archetype also
stand in a hierarchical relation of subservience to moral ends in Jung&rsquo;s
clinical theory. Through imaginative attention to inner affective states of mind
we become conscious of desire and conflict and have to make decisions for what
we perceive as the good. This point has been too little noticed in some Jungian
circles in recent years, with the result that fantasy has sometimes come to be
valued as an end in itself. But it then becomes empty of all significance for
human <span class="nb">life&thinsp;&mdash;</span>&thinsp;a truly narcissistic occupation which would be entirely antithetic
to Jung&rsquo;s own goals. (Nagy, 1991, pp.159-60)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The phenomenological psychologists hold the epistemologically obscure view
that &ldquo;nothing is more primary than the image&rdquo; and that the psyche is
an &ldquo;imagining activity&rdquo; (Hillman, 1997, p.14). Thus, everything else by necessity recedes into
the background, most notably any underlying feelings. In Nagy&rsquo;s words, this
ideal of fantasying activity must develop into a narcissistic occupation. But in &ldquo;The Souls Code&rdquo; (1996) 
James&nbsp;Hillman, fully consistently, defends the narcissistic attitude of the &lsquo;puer
aeternus&rsquo; (also called the Peter&nbsp;Pan type), as
this figure is taken for an exemplary model (cf. Winther, 1999, <a href="hillmcrit.htm" title="Critique of Archetypal Psychology">here</a>). Contrary to a one-sided imagining activity, Jung pleads for a whole-hearted
commitment to the unconscious:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>[The] mere execution of the pictures is not enough. Over and above
that, an intellectual and emotional understanding is needed; they require to be
not only rationally integrated with the conscious mind, but morally assimilated.
They still have to be subjected to a work of synthetic interpretation. Although
I have travelled this path with individual patients many times, I have never yet
succeeded in making all the details of the process clear enough for publication&nbsp;[&hellip;] The truth is, we are here moving in absolutely new territory, and a
ripening of experience is the first requisite&nbsp;[&hellip;] We are dealing with a
process of psychic life outside consciousness, and our observation of it is
indirect. As yet we do not know to what depths our vision will plumb.
(Jung, 1993, p.51)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Accordingly, Jolande&nbsp;Jacobi explains that the content of the psyche
overreaches the image and transcends consciousness:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The symbol is not an allegory and not a sign, but an image of
content that largely transcends consciousness. Yet symbols can &lsquo;degenerate&rsquo; into
signs and become &lsquo;dead symbols&rsquo; when the meaning hidden within them is fully
revealed, when it loses its richness of implication because its whole content
has been made accessible to reason. For an authentic symbol can never be fully
explained. We can open up the rational part of it to our consciousness, but the
irrational part can only be &lsquo;brought home to our feeling&rsquo; (Jacobi, 1973, p.97).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>We realize, then, that the &ldquo;plastic preachers&rdquo; (along with many
notorious kinsmen in &ldquo;plastic&rdquo; American Christendom), have turned the
message upside-down. Contrary to their understanding, the unconscious is &ldquo;always
greater&rdquo; and overreaches the products of the conscious mind. By
concentrating on a spiritual and numinous feeling, images are allowed to emerge. However,
these images cannot exhaust the meaning of the numinous feeling. Since archetypal psychologists argue that &ldquo;[phantasy images are] both the
raw materials and finished products of the psyche&rdquo; (Hillman, 1992, xi), it engenders a
hubristic standpoint, well-known from the romantic era of philosophy. Johann&nbsp;Gottlieb&nbsp;Fichte (1762-1814) argued that the ego is world-creating, due to the fact that everything is image and illusion (Encyc., <a href="http://www.encyclopedia.com/humanities/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/fichte-johann-gottlieb-1762-1814" title="Fichte, Johann Gottlieb (1762–1814)">here</a>).
</P>
<P>Since Hillman&rsquo;s followers assert that the image is the most fundamental
entity, the subject acquires a world-creating capability, being the exponent
and creator of images. This explains why they propound hubristic notions to the
effect that images become autonomous and godlike:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The autochtonous quality of images as independent of the
subjective imagination which does the perceiving takes Casey&rsquo;s idea one step
further&nbsp;[&hellip;] but then comes the awareness that images are independent of
subjectivity and even of imagination itself as a mental activity.
(Hillman, 1997, p.15)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This brings out a call to &ldquo;return to Greek polytheism&rdquo; (Hillman, 1992, p.27). Thus, the &ldquo;plastic
preachers&rdquo; have ventured far from Jung&rsquo;s standpoint. This comes from
the fact that the archetypes are treated as if they were mere images. Against
this Marian&nbsp;L.&nbsp;Pauson says:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>One may acknowledge the realm of the gods, but as long as one is
in the land of the living one is not permitted to dwell too exclusively in the
divine sphere. Life is essentially dynamic. The gods live through human beings;
without human life the gods become empty symbols. To live a too symbolic life, a
life apart from the full engagement of the body in all of its dimensions in
process, is to aspire to the realm of the gods and to commit the sin of hubris,
for which in all mythologies a human being is repeatedly punished. Herculean ego
effort, however, is not the only alternative. Somewhere between the two extremes
lies the path. Jung warned against a too symbolic life in which emotional
powers or &ldquo;numinosities&rdquo; of the archetypes are brushed aside or
repressed. In referring to those who admit of the existence of the archetypes,
but then treat them as if they were mere images and forget that they are living
entities that make up a great part of the human psyche, he says, <BR> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;As soon
as the interpreter strips them of their numinosity, they lose their life and
become mere words. It is then easy enough to link them together with other
mythological representations, and so the process of limitless substitution
begins; one glides from archetype to archetype, everything means everything, and
one has reduced the whole process to absurdity. All the corpses in the world are
chemically identical, but living individuals are not. It is true that the forms
of archetypes are to a considerable extent interchangeable, but the numinosity
is and remains a fact. It represents the value of an archetypal event. This
emotional value must be kept in mind and allowed for throughout the whole
intellectual process of interpretation. The risk of losing is great, because
thinking&hellip; abolishes feeling values and vice versa.&rsquo; (Pauson, 1988, pp.65-66)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>As Jung warrants a whole-hearted commitment to life, Pauson underscores the
disparity of Jungian and archetypal psychology:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I suggest, following these words from &ldquo;Memories, Dreams,
Reflections,&rdquo; an important difference between Jung&rsquo;s ideal and that
presented in archetypal psychology, in James&nbsp;Hillman, &ldquo;The
Dream and the Underworld,&rdquo; and Roberts&nbsp;Avens, &ldquo;Imagination
is Reality.&rdquo; (Pauson, 1988, p.69)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>As the archetypal school gives free rein to any imagining activity, even the
theoretical concepts become malleable in their hands. They can be redefined and
wrought past recognition. Although people overtly
ask for more nourishing material (edible spiritual bread) there is nothing to be
had; only plastic theoretical notions that couldn&rsquo;t survive scrutiny. In the future, I&rsquo;d wish that Jungian psychology opens up an earnest internal
debate, instead of naively gobbling up all strange notions that surface among
secondary theorists. In other scientific disciplines one looks at all
contributions with stringent critical eyes. Although disquieting, harsh
arguments are necessary if Jungian psychology is not to turn into a virtual
rubbish-heap. <SPAN class="nobr">Marie-Louise von Franz,</SPAN> alone unable to halt the
flood of rubbish, saw no other possibility than to bail out and found a new
psychological institute.</P>
