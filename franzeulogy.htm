It was a great good fortune in the life of Marie-Louise von Franz that she met C. G. Jung when she was an eighteen year old high school student in Zurich and soon after to be permitted to work with him.  Borne by a deep devotion and love for him, she created her rich work with unheard of discipline and relentless rigor.  When we read her articles and books, we often get the impression that thanks to her far-reaching erudition she could just write things down.  She confessed to one of her nurses that every sentence she wrote was a heavy stone she had to lift.  She once told me that a man could work for an objective and give his whole life to it, but a woman could bring forth the superhuman for a beloved person.  When Jung died she thought she would never be able to write another word.  She had to learn from the ground up that intention to write towards an objective.  But I believe that to the very end she always wrote out of her love for Jung.
<img src="/img/people/vonfranz_150.jpg" alt=" " width=150 HEIGHT=203 border="0" align="left" HSPACE=4>
<p>
The fact that she was incurably ill and was dependent on caregivers from outside for many years brought before many of us the question of life's meaning.  Probably she had really overworked herself.  But in the background still stands the question of God.  Why did God let this woman, who worked with such a religious devotion to God's growth into consciousness and redemption and sacrificed for Him all of life's comforts, suffer so long?
<p>
She was able to take her fate onto herself, which she gave us to understand at various times.  Once she told me that in her younger years Jung had consulted an African oracle with her.  It had said:  At the end, the highest judge will come - this would be an unheard of fortune, and as a matter of fact she experienced many amazing things; many of them had to be kept secret, so she couldn't relate them to me.  But then later would come an "after-judge."  This would be a great misfortune.  This would be her present illness.  But she was happy that she had consulted this oracle, because she knew that this misfortune was a part of her fate!  She had no illusions; she knew that God was not only to be loved but to be feared.  Once when I spoke with her of her illness I asserted that humans could feel compassion more than God.  She answered, "Yes, nature is astonishingly intelligent, but frightfully cruel!"
<p>
She carried her fate not just with equanimity.  Four years ago she had the flu and did not want to eat, thinking that now she had her solution; she simply would eat no more and the problem would solve itself.  Then she dreamed:
<p>
<font face="arial, helvetica, sans">She was at the Enge train station in Zurich.  She put her leg across the rails and thought that the train would run over her.  But as the engine came out of the tunnel she cried out for help.  Somehow she was rescued and then a dark cloud obscured everything so that she could see nothing.  In this darkness she felt the fur of a big dog and held tightly onto it.  Then the dog spoke with a human voice, "Don't do that!  Everything is organized!"</font>
<p>
As she related the dream she smiled impishly:  it is all organized, the ticket arranged, the hotel reserved!  She knew now she must endure her suffering and wait longer.
<p>
Before and after this she had many beautiful and gripping  dreams that pointed to her life's consummation and brought her deep happiness.  I would like to lay a few of these dreams before you.  She dreamed:
<p>
<font face="arial, helvetica, sans">She is near a farmhouse; many people in black are there.  A young farm worker digs a hole for the coffin.  Out of the coffin comes an old man who suffers the same illness as she.  He absolutely wants to live.  The fellow argues with him, saying that he belongs back in there, throws him in the coffin and shuts the lid.  She herself takes no part in it and thinks:  "This has nothing to do with me."  In the yard stands a tree.  She thinks that it is a horse-chestnut.  But it is a marvelously beautiful tree with dinner-plate sized passion flowers which she herself had once planted.  In each blossom is a little tomato.  She plucks one, eats it and knows that it is the "cibus immortalis," the food of immortality.</font>
<p>
Then she said that the old man was the will to live that will not give up, but only extends her suffering.  The worker believes it is time to die.  Years later as it became harder to eat because of her illness, she said that she wanted to eat because the will to live is generally the strongest drive in life.  She added that in Austria tomatoes are called " paradises."  And tomatoes are often taken to be the "love fruits" from the Tree of Knowledge.
<p>
In summer of 1994 she was visited by a woman, a medium, who wanted to convince her to collaborate with her; she was certain that the Christian and the Buddhist spirit were presently uniting on the other side in order to save the world.  Marie-Louise promised nothing - she wanted first to see what she might dream.  The following night she had this dream:
<p>
<font face="arial, helvetica, sans">She is working in the laundry at the cloister in Einsiedeln.  She is given to understand that Jung would come down from heaven to the wedding of the Black Madonna.  Marie-Louise is among the one hundred elect who are permitted to take part in the wedding.</font>
<p>
She then said that the unconscious was indeed preparing a remedy for the world and a union, to be sure not one "above in the spiritual realm," but a union of above and below, a union of spirit and matter.  Very early on the Virgin Mary was thought to be "the earth;" the Black Madonna was a nature goddess.  And yet the union comes about in a Christian framework, which she (Mary-Louise) never could accept.  But still the dream filled her with the highest happiness.
<p>
Two years ago she dreamed that:
<p>
 <font face="arial, helvetica, sans">She saw a tree in exquisite bloom.  But it stood in water and didn't have much earth around it.</font> 
<p>
With the deepest earnestness she said that she wanted us to know that one puff of wind could topple it. In August of last year she said that she had dreamed:
<p>
<font face="arial, helvetica, sans">She had written an eight volume work on Arabic alchemy.  She had the eight volumes in front of her and she was quite happy about them.</font>
<p>
She understood the dream as affirming that her life's work was now finished.
Last November she dreamed:
<p>
<font face="arial, helvetica, sans">It is evening and she must rake up the hay so that the dew of the night will not make it damp.  It is understood that night will come quickly!</font>
<p>
She said that this meant she must put her affairs in order.  At Christmas she said that now she would fight no more - this was new for her; until now she had always fought.  She was mentally alert and entirely clear, interested in every single one who visited her, and in what was happening in the world, and remained so to the very end.  But it was often difficult to understand her, because from time to time she could hardly speak.
<p>
She wanted to die, and she had no fear of death.  Many years ago she said that with her book On Dreams and Death she had convinced herself that life goes on after death.  One of the women who took care of Marie-Louise over a period of many years, often at great sacrifice, and to whom we cannot be thankful enough, had a dream when she spent the night with her a few weeks before her death.  The woman dreamed:
<p>
<font face="arial, helvetica, sans">She went down the stairs to the floor below, where Marie-Louise slept.  There in the doorway stood C. G. Jung as an older, well-dressed man, quite the aspect of wisdom.  He smiled at the dreamer, went in to Marie-Louise and sat beside her on her bed, and the two had a long, intimate, congenial conversation.</font>
<p>
Marie-Louise von Franz was overjoyed when she heard the dream, because she now knew that Jung would accompany her to the other side.  She would be there with him and perhaps with the people to whom she in truth belonged.
<p>
She knew for a long time that Jung lived "there."  She gave him as a lifetime gift a rare Chinese frog carved from stone.  He found the gift much too precious and it was determined that this treasure be returned to her after his death.  A few weeks after his death she dreamed:
<p>
<font face="arial, helvetica, sans">She saw in a brook something that she took to be human excrement - "something man-made," she thought.  As she stepped closer she saw that it was this frog.  Suddenly it lifted its foreleg and waved at her.</font>
<p>
For her, this was a sign that Jung was still living, and she died with this frog in her hand.  The frog is a symbol of resurrection.
<p>
She died on February 17, 1998, at 2:15 in the morning.  A few years ago (November 3, 1994), she dreamed:
<p>
<font face="arial, helvetica, sans">In an old city a new building with seventeen regular sides comprising its perimeter had been built, a feat that was earlier considered impossible.</font>
<p>
In Arabic alchemy the seventeen-sided form meant the union of psyche and matter, exactly what the core of her research had established.  Seventeen is as well the number of complete individuation, achieved wholeness.
<p>
In spite of that, we must not forget:  death is also a terrifying event.  But these dreams in the neighborhood of death show us the merciful countenance of God.  It is for us and surely for the world a measureless grant of providence and a blessing that a woman like Marie-Louise von Franz lived and that we were permitted to encounter her.  Her spirit lives on . . .
