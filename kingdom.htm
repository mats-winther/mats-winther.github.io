    <p><br>
    <i>Abstract</i>: This article examines Albertus Magnus&rsquo;s insight that the kingdom of God exists primarily
    within God&rsquo;s mind, manifesting as both heavenly reality and spiritual presence in human souls. Drawing on
    Neoplatonic traditions, it challenges static conceptions of Platonic forms, proposing instead that eternal patterns
    in God&rsquo;s consciousness are inherently dynamic and mythological&#8239;&mdash;&thinsp;eternal dramas rather
    than frozen blueprints. The paper integrates perspectives from Eriugena, Coleridge, von&nbsp;Balthasar, Aulén, and
    Eliade to develop a &ldquo;kingdom model&rdquo; locating spiritual beings and mythic narratives within divine
    consciousness, preserving both divine aseity and God&rsquo;s dramatic engagement with creation. This framework
    resolves theological tensions: it explains divine violence as mythic rather than material, clarifies
    temporal-eternal relationships, and recovers faith&rsquo;s participatory nature as mythic consciousness.
    Jesus&rsquo;s kingdom proclamation and Paul&rsquo;s spiritual warfare language reflect this ontological reality
    where earthly events participate in, but do not exhaust, eternal mythic patterns in God&rsquo;s mind. By
    distinguishing material causation from symbolic participation, this approach offers an alternative to both
    literalist fundamentalism and reductive modernism, suggesting that mythology represents not primitive
    anthropomorphism but recognition of reality&rsquo;s narrative structure within divine consciousness.<br>

    <span class="bigger">Introduction</span><br>
    <br>
    &ldquo;Reason&rdquo; in medieval philosophy doesn&rsquo;t mean logical thinking but the inherent pattern that makes
    something what it is and determines how it acts. The &ldquo;eternal reasons&rdquo; (<i>rationes aeternae</i>) are
    God&rsquo;s own archetypal patterns for all created things, both species and individuals. These function like
    Plato&rsquo;s forms, but instead of existing in some separate realm, they exist within God&rsquo;s own mind as the
    blueprints of reality. Every creature has its defining pattern eternally present in God&rsquo;s consciousness, and
    this pattern is what gives it both its being and its characteristic way of acting.<br>
    <br>
    However, if the forms exist in Mind (<i>Nous</i>), why would they be static? The mind operates dynamically through
    activities like thinking, knowing, and understanding, rather than existing in static states. This insistence on
    static forms stems from several philosophical anxieties. Greek philosophical thought inherited from Parmenides the
    fundamental dichotomy between immutable Being and mutable Becoming. Plato, trying to save both permanence and
    change, located permanence in the forms. But this created the bizarre notion of &ldquo;frozen&rdquo; perfection, as
    if dynamism were itself an imperfection.<br>
    <br>
    Augustine inherits this but compounds it with a particular reading of God&rsquo;s eternity as &ldquo;all at
    once&rdquo; (<i>totum simul</i>). This gets interpreted as static simultaneity rather than as dramatic movements
    eternally present in their full vitality. Boethius&rsquo;s <i>interminabilis vitae tota simul</i> (the whole
    simultaneous possession of interminable life) suggests dynamism, but tradition reads it statically.<br>
    <br>
    Classical theism fears that dynamic forms would make God temporal or changing. But this conflates two different
    things: temporal succession (which God transcends) and eternal dynamism. The Trinity manifests eternal dynamism
    through its processions, relations, and the dance of <i>perichoresis</i>, while transcending temporal change.<br>
    <br>
    This reductionist tendency has diminished forms to mere concepts, obscuring their nature as living ontological
    patterns. A concept of justice might be static, but the Form of Justice as divine knowing would include all the
    dramatic movements of justice, such as conflict with injustice, vindication, and restoration. The form would be
    more like an eternal story than a frozen definition. By viewing the forms as mythic patterns rather than static
    concepts, we may recover what God&rsquo;s mind must actually be like. God apprehends not static blueprints but
    eternal narratives, such as creation, fall, redemption and glorification, all perpetually unfolding within divine
    consciousness.<br>
    <br>
    This explains why Scripture presents divine knowledge through dramatic narratives rather than philosophical
    definitions. The Bible isn&rsquo;t being primitive; it&rsquo;s being accurate to how God&rsquo;s mind actually
    works. God&rsquo;s self-knowledge includes all the mythic movements (divine warrior defeating chaos, shepherd
    gathering sheep, king establishing kingdom), not as past events but as eternal activities in divine
    consciousness.<br>
    <br>
    The mythological reading restores dynamism to divine consciousness. The forms aren&rsquo;t frozen statues in
    God&rsquo;s mental museum but living patterns; stories, conflicts, victories, and transformations, eternally
    enacted in divine awareness. This doesn&rsquo;t make God temporal any more than having multiple ideas makes God
    multiple.<br>
    <br>
    With this insight we recover what ancient philosophy lost when it made the fatal equation: perfection&nbsp;=
    stasis. Since God is pure act (as even Thomists insist), God&rsquo;s consciousness must be pure activity, not bare
    motion but activity that is patterned, mythological, and dramatic. The forms aren&rsquo;t photographs but eternal
    dramas playing in divine consciousness, which we temporal beings experience in sequential fragments.<br>
    <br>
    This theological move can preserve divine aseity while maintaining the biblical narrative structure. It offers a
    creative solution to the apparent tension between God&rsquo;s self-sufficiency and his involvement in conflict and
    suffering. This preserves aseity because God still requires nothing external to himself. The entire cosmic drama,
    mythic themes, and conflicts between divine and demonic forces are all internal to God&rsquo;s own mental life. God
    isn&rsquo;t dependent on anything outside himself because there is no &lsquo;outside&rsquo;: the heavenly realm
    where these mythic events unfold exists within the divine mind.<br>
    <br>
    Contemporary interpretations of God&rsquo;s kingdom as an ideal earthly social order find minimal support in
    Jesus&rsquo;s teachings. Thus, the kingdom becomes merely horizontal, limited to perfected human relationships
    rather than humanity participating in heavenly patterns. This view implies the kingdom is built through human
    effort, through better politics, economics, and social activism. The modern interpretation effectively
    de-supernaturalizes the kingdom, turning wine back into water. It keeps the ethical demands while discarding the
    mystical source, creating a Christianity that&rsquo;s all imperative and no indicative&#8239;&mdash;&thinsp;all
    &ldquo;ought&rdquo; with no transforming &ldquo;is.&rdquo;<br>
    <br>
    But the kingdom is something we receive and enter, not construct. It descends from above; it doesn&rsquo;t emerge
    from below. The kingdom indeed produces social transformation, but as overflow from transformed consciousness, not
    as its primary reality. Justice and peace flow from souls aligned with heavenly patterns, not from better
    organizational structures.<br>
    <br>
    Moreover, situating the kingdom solely in earthly future eliminates the &lsquo;already&rsquo; dimension: our
    present participation in eternal patterns. The kingdom becomes mere hope rather than present mystical reality with
    future manifestation. The spirit world in Scripture is about cosmic conflict, which aren&rsquo;t metaphors for
    social reform but eternal patterns being actualized.<br>
    <br>
    <span class="bigger">Albertus Magnus</span><br>
    <br>
    Unlike modern theologians, Albert the Great (1206&#8239;&ndash;&thinsp;1280) locates the kingdom in the mind of
    God, which manifests itself both as the heavenly kingdom and as the kingdom within the human soul. He says:</p>
    <blockquote>
      And this is the kingdom through which God reigns in us. And just as the first kingdom is the soul of the true
      king, whose illuminations and orders and laws and acts multiplied in the people constitute the kingdom, so this
      kingdom is first in the mind of God and extends through everything. And the kingdom which is in heaven outside us
      is similar to this, but is more similar to the kingdom of the divine mind, which is the third and is the exemplar
      and object and cause of the other two kingdoms. (Albertus, 1987, cap.&#8239;III, 3, p.&#8239;68)
    </blockquote>
    <p>This Neoplatonic framework presents some complexity. After all, heaven needn&rsquo;t be viewed as a separate
    created space but as full immersion in God&rsquo;s mythic consciousness. The saints and angels don&rsquo;t observe
    God&rsquo;s patterns from outside: they swim in them, participate in them, <i>are</i> them by participation. The
    concept of heaven as divine contemplation, populated by angels and demons, is more accessible to modern thought
    than the idea of heaven as an independent metaphysical realm.<br>
    <br>
    The heavenly realm, though transcendent, belongs to creation rather than to God&rsquo;s essence, existing eternally
    in divine contemplation. According to tradition, the patterns in God&rsquo;s mind possess greater reality than
    earthly things, which exist only by participating in their heavenly archetypes. The drama unfolding above is more
    real than anything in the material world, which, after all, reduces to mere interactions of molecules, atoms, and
    quarks.<br>
    <br>
    Albertus Magnus, following in the Neoplatonic and Aristotelian tradition, understood God&rsquo;s mind as containing
    all possible forms and ideas. However, for Albert, the divine intellect wasn&rsquo;t passive but actively
    contemplated all reality. The crucial insight is that God&rsquo;s self-contemplation isn&rsquo;t empty or static:
    it&rsquo;s infinitely rich and dynamic. If the kingdom of God with all its mythic drama exists within God&rsquo;s
    mind, then all the conflict, suffering, and narrative development occur within God&rsquo;s own
    self-contemplation.<br>
    <br>
    The kingdom of God in God&rsquo;s mind might experience narrative time, with sequences of before and after,
    conflict and resolution, while God himself remains eternal. This isn&rsquo;t a contradiction but rather reflects
    how an eternal mind can contain temporal sequences. God timelessly contemplates a drama that unfolds in narrative
    time.<br>
    <br>
    This framework offers a response to the classical problem of how an immutable God can relate to a changing world.
    If the kingdom of God in God&rsquo;s mind contains genuine narrative and conflict, then God can be both unchanging
    in his essence while containing infinite change and drama within his self-contemplation. The suffering God
    wouldn&rsquo;t compromise divine perfection because this suffering occurs within God&rsquo;s own infinite mental
    life. As a novelist&rsquo;s excellence remains undiminished through imagining tragic events, God&rsquo;s perfection
    persists intact while encompassing suffering within narrative consciousness. Indeed, a story without conflict and
    suffering might be seen as imperfect, lacking depth and meaning.<br>
    <br>
    Augustine and Aquinas held that God knows all things by knowing himself: the divine ideas are God&rsquo;s knowledge
    of the ways his essence can be imitated. In <i>De diversis qu&aelig;stionibus</i> (46), Augustine locates all
    eternal forms within God&rsquo;s mind. The dynamic view of forms, however, expands beyond the Platonic concept: God
    knows not merely static forms but entire mythic narratives, complete with conflict and resolution. The celestial
    forms are not blueprints but living stories, more real than their worldly manifestations.<br>
    <br>
    This provides a metaphysical foundation for the reality of myth. If mythic themes exist in God&rsquo;s mind with
    the same ontological status as the kingdom of God, then mythology isn&rsquo;t merely human invention but
    participation in divine thought. The great myths across cultures might be understood as fragmentary glimpses into
    the vast mythic drama playing out in God&rsquo;s mind.<br>
    <br>
    Just as the Egyptian Duat existed in a liminal space, neither purely physical nor purely spiritual, so the kingdom
    of God in God&rsquo;s mind occupies a unique ontological position. It&rsquo;s more real than physical reality
    (being directly in God&rsquo;s mind) yet it operates according to narrative rather than physical laws.<br>
    <br>
    The synthesis of mythic theology with divine aseity through Albert&rsquo;s understanding of God&rsquo;s mind offers
    a profound way forward. It suggests that taking seriously both God&rsquo;s transcendence and his mythological
    engagement doesn&rsquo;t require choosing between them. Instead, the mythic drama is the very content of
    God&rsquo;s eternal self-contemplation, preserving divine self-sufficiency while affirming the reality of divine
    involvement in conflict and suffering.<br>
    <br>
    <span class="bigger">Eriugena</span><br>
    <br>
    While various theological traditions hint at this insight, Albert&rsquo;s explicit articulation remains
    distinctive. John&nbsp;Scotus&nbsp;Eriugena (815&#8239;&ndash;&thinsp;877) develops the crucial concept of
    primordial causes existing eternally in the Word. He uses the Greek term &lsquo;proorismata&rsquo;
    (predeterminations) to describe how all reality preexists in God&rsquo;s mind before temporal manifestation. He
    states:</p>
    <blockquote>
      All things that are made in him, in him are life and are one. All things
      were&#8239;&mdash;&thinsp;subsist&#8239;&mdash;&thinsp;in him as causes before they are in themselves as effects.
      For the things that are made through him are beneath him in one way; and the things that he is are in him in
      another. All things, therefore, that were made by the Word, live in him unchangeably and are life. In him all
      things exist neither by temporal intervals or places, nor as what is to come; but all are one in him, above all
      times and places, and subsist in him eternally. Visible, invisible, corporeal, incorporeal, rational,
      irrational&#8239;&mdash;&thinsp;heaven and earth, the abyss, and whatever is therein&#8239;&mdash;&thinsp;in him
      all live and are life and subsist eternally. Even what seems to us to be without all vital movement lives in the
      Word. (Eriugena, 2000, chs.&nbsp;IX-X)
    </blockquote>
    <p>Everything within the Word is both eternal and created. The Word&rsquo;s content, being both causal and alive,
    functions as a dynamic process. The very continuance of the created universe requires the speech of God the Father,
    the eternal and unchangeable generation of his Word (ch.&#8239;XVIII). The <i>Homily</i> emphasizes that the Word
    encompasses not merely abstract concepts but living, corporeal realities. This recalls Plato&rsquo;s forms: not
    abstract universals in the modern sense, but transcendent particulars&#8239;&mdash;&thinsp;perfect, eternal
    entities that serve as models for earthly things (cf. Grabowski&nbsp;III, 2008).<br>
    <br>
    In <i>Periphyseon</i> (1987), Eriugena emphasizes that all things exist eternally in the Divine Word, sharing in
    God&rsquo;s Wisdom, yet emerge from nothingness. As he states: &ldquo;Hence it is concluded that in the Wisdom of
    the Father all things are eternal, but are not coeternal with it&rdquo; (636A). He further maintains that Paradise
    exists as a spiritual realm inhabited by &ldquo;celestial and spiritual bodies as they will be after the
    resurrection&rdquo; (571C).<br>
    <br>
    Christ existed simultaneously in paradise and in the world, since his movement was not a physical relocation from
    one place to another (538C). The Son of God&rsquo;s descent from heaven, therefore, did not diminish his continued
    presence there. This aligns with what has been previously argued: spiritual bodies, existing in divine mind,
    transcend the constraints of space and time.<br>
    <br>
    Although both Eriugena and Albert present ideas that could lead to a new understanding of the kingdom of God,
    neither philosopher fully develops these implications. The Epistle to the Hebrews, however, provides compelling
    support for this argument by presenting heavenly realities as dynamic, liturgical events rather than static states.
    The letter depicts heaven not as a place but as an ongoing liturgical drama, with Christ as the eternal high priest
    &ldquo;always living to make intercession&rdquo; (7:25). The heavenly sanctuary functions not as a building but as
    an eternal liturgical event, in which earthly worship participates while remaining only its shadow. Christ&rsquo;s
    continuous appearance before God (9:24) suggests that events in the kingdom of God are not past occurrences but
    eternal activities. Through worship, believers participate in this eternal event, partially now, fully in the
    eschaton.<br>
    <br>
    <span class="bigger">Von Balthasar</span><br>
    <br>
    Hans Urs von Balthasar&rsquo;s massive five-volume &ldquo;Theo-Drama&rdquo; portrays an ideal picture of history as
    divine drama, where humans are actors playing roles in God&rsquo;s theatrical production. While he maintains
    traditional metaphysical language and doesn&rsquo;t explicitly frame divine consciousness in mythological terms, he
    avoids dividing mythic and material realms, instead placing the theo-drama entirely within the earthly sphere.
    However, according to classical thought, any manifestation on earth must necessarily reflect its heavenly
    counterpart through the principle of participation.<br>
    <br>
    Although von Balthasar emphasizes the single Christian theo-drama rather than multiple mythic patterns, it&rsquo;s
    evident this moves beyond static metaphysics towards dynamic mythology. When he sees the world as a stage which God
    has set up for the enactment of his divine-human drama, he is approaching the notion of creation as actualization
    of mythic patterns in the kingdom of God.<br>
    <br>
    Thus, von Balthasar argues that existence itself has dramatic rather than merely conceptual structure. God
    doesn&rsquo;t simply <i>have</i> ideas but <i>performs</i> an eternal drama. However, this perspective implies that
    God is directly involved in earthly events, actively guiding human actions: &ldquo;On the human stage he
    &lsquo;plays&rsquo; through human beings and ultimately <i>as</i> a human being&rdquo; (von&nbsp;Balthasar, 1988,
    p.&#8239;19). This view aligns with the Reformers&rsquo; strict determinism, exemplified by Luther&rsquo;s
    assertion that humans are inevitably controlled either by God or the devil.<br>
    <br>
    The kingdom model, in contrast, grants autonomy to spiritual beings such as angels and demons. Through
    participation in heavenly patterns, the drama of earthly history becomes an imperfect reflection of its heavenly
    counterpart.<br>
    <br>
    Theo-drama provides crucial theoretical foundations for symbolic participation, although von&nbsp;Balthasar never
    extends this to view God&rsquo;s consciousness itself as mythically structured in the ontological Platonic sense.
    Nevertheless, his insights about role-consciousness, dramatic participation, and the theatrical nature of reality
    offer essential support. His theo-dramatic theory suggests ways humans can consciously embody typological roles
    while maintaining practical rationality.<br>
    <br>
    According to von Balthasar, ontological being is not static but is continually constituted through dramatic action:
    <i>agere sequitur esse</i> (action follows being) and <i>esse sequitur agere</i> (being follows action). The divine
    idea is not a fixed, eternally predetermined schema but a &ldquo;moving idea.&rdquo; However, as a Catholic
    thinker, he remains constrained by Aristotelian metaphysics, which asserts that the Ideal is inherently bound to
    material existence: the <i>eidos</i> does not exist as such but exists always only in particulars. Therefore, each
    individual form (<i>morph&emacr;</i>) contributes the entirety of what constitutes the ideal form (<i>eidos</i>)
    (cf. Schindler, 2004, pp.&#8239;76-90).<br>
    <br>
    Von Balthasar argues that drama inherently requires tension and conflict, through which synthesis emerges.
    Consequently, he embraces Gustaf&nbsp;Aulén&rsquo;s Christus Victor theory, which portrays Christ&rsquo;s triumph
    over Satan, evil, sin, and death through cosmic struggle. Accordingly, he says that &ldquo;Aulén calls for new
    forms so that the abiding, fundamental conflict between God and the hostile powers can be expressed, not purely
    monistically nor purely dualistically, but dramatically&rdquo; (von&nbsp;Balthasar, 1990, p.&#8239;163).<br>
    <br>
    Von Balthasar&rsquo;s immanentist theology, which echoes Hegelian thought, fundamentally conflicts with an
    ontological kingdom model. However, if his Aristotelian framework were replaced with a Platonic one, his theology
    could align more closely with biblical testimony.<br>
    <br>
    <span class="bigger">Coleridge</span><br>
    <br>
    Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1772&#8239;&ndash;&thinsp;1834), English poet and philosopher, reformulated Platonism by
    defining an Idea as God&rsquo;s creative act, one that participates in infinity. Rather than a static abstraction
    or an ideal that things merely approximate, an Idea functions as an internal, dynamic force that is living,
    productive and contains an endless power of self-propagation (cf. Coleridge, 1884, p.&#8239;433). Through
    participatory symbolism, Coleridge shows how God becomes present to humanity in everyday experience. The symbol
    enables participation in both historical reality and representational meaning, uniting history and myth (cf.
    Swiatecka, 1980, ch.&#8239;2). Thus, a symbol is &ldquo;not a metaphor or allegory or any other figure of speech or
    form of fancy, but an actual and essential part of that, the whole of which it represents&rdquo; (Coleridge, 1884,
    p.&#8239;465).<br>
    <br>
    Mary Jadwiga Swiatecka distinguishes between Coleridge&rsquo;s symbols and Plato&rsquo;s cave analogy. While
    Plato&rsquo;s analogy illustrates static Ideals, Coleridge&rsquo;s symbols function as visible manifestations of a
    deeper ontological reality:</p>
    <blockquote>
      According to Plato, it is only those who have &lsquo;painfully&rsquo; averted their gaze from the shadow world to
      look at the Reality itself who will eventually be able to discern the true meaning of the shadows on the cave
      wall. But in Coleridge&rsquo;s lines there is no hint that such a turning away is necessary. The suggestion is,
      rather, that it is by continuing to sit &ldquo;with our backs to bright Reality,&rdquo; continuing, therefore, to
      look at the shadows before us, that, nevertheless, we learn to distinguish &ldquo;the substance from the
      shadow.&rdquo; What, then, can such a &ldquo;substance&rdquo; be? What can be better seen by looking at shadows
      than can be seen by turning away from them, even if (eventually) to return?<br>
      <br>
      I suggest that this is that aspect of &ldquo;Reality&rdquo; which is its pattern, its movement, its developing
      process. We have seen that in this passage the &ldquo;Reality&rdquo; is God, who is seen both as the
      &ldquo;latence&rdquo; and &ldquo;plenitude of all,&rdquo; and is revealed in &ldquo;powers&rdquo; as well as
      &ldquo;things.&rdquo; What is still missing, if we compare this with Coleridge&rsquo;s concept of God in relation
      to the universe as previously sketched, is the notion of the universe as a developing pattern, whose movement, as
      well as that movement&rsquo;s ultimate resolution, is God. It is this lack which is made good in
      Coleridge&rsquo;s (as distinct from Plato&rsquo;s) image here.<br>
      <br>
      For in fact it is easier for us to discern a pattern of movement, to see things in close interrelation, in a
      two-dimensional shadow projection, than it is if we look at a multitude of detailed things in a coloured and
      three-dimensional perspective. In other words, the &ldquo;shadow&rdquo; in Coleridge&rsquo;s image may be
      predominantly a modification, a simplification, of Reality, in which we discern Reality in this particular way,
      namely as pattern. It is not &ldquo;shadow&rdquo; in the sense of being a pale reflection, a ghostlike
      anticipation, an &lsquo;adumbration&rsquo; of something &lsquo;more real,&rsquo; &lsquo;more substantial.&rsquo;
      It is attached to Reality not simply at one (invisible) point, as the shadow of a tree is linked to it only at
      its base, and part of it in that sense. The Reality, as pattern, transfuses the shadow and is made visible in it.
      (Swiatecka, 1980, pp.&#8239;62-63)
    </blockquote>
    <p>According to Coleridge, the Bible exemplifies this symbolic language&rsquo;s participatory power: as a symbol,
    it functions not merely metaphorically but actually as &ldquo;the Word of God&rdquo; through its unity with
    heavenly reality. Like Christ&rsquo;s activity, the Bible operates creatively, not just recording truth but
    actively enabling perception of it. This symbolic quality extends to all language that achieves symbolic status.
    Such symbolic language transcends mere representation of human thoughts, instead participating in ongoing
    divine-human creative thinking. When language functions symbolically, it enables direct experience of
    transcendental reality, moving beyond description of <i>natura naturata</i> (created nature) to participation in
    <i>natura naturans</i> (creative force).<br>
    <br>
    Through symbols, the inner light of Christ connects with external divine power. However, this creative illumination
    requires both the symbol&rsquo;s inherent potential and the reader&rsquo;s active engagement with heavenly Reason.
    Thus symbolic language, like the Bible and Nature itself, becomes transparent to heavenly wisdom through
    participatory understanding rather than mere metaphorical interpretation (cf. Swiatecka, 1980,
    pp.&#8239;57-58).<br>
    <br>
    Although often mischaracterized as a romantic idealist philosopher, Coleridge belongs to the
    Platonic/<wbr>Neoplatonic realist tradition. His philosophical framework appears compatible with the kingdom
    model.<br>
    <br>
    <span class="bigger">Paul of Tarsus</span><br>
    <br>
    Paul mentions the kingdom of God sparingly, likely due to its political connotations in the Roman Empire (cf. Acts
    17:6-7). However, as Guy&nbsp;Williams demonstrates in his thorough study (2011), the spirit world, though often
    neglected in modern scholarship, was integral to Paul&rsquo;s religious and cultural heritage. Spiritual beings are
    thus integral to Paul&rsquo;s writings. Modern theology has largely ignored this dimension, fearing it implies a
    rigid dualism between spiritual and material realms. However, as previously argued, belief in God necessarily
    entails belief in God&rsquo;s mind, which in Augustinian theology contains ontologically real forms. These forms
    could be reinterpreted as dynamic entities, as spiritual beings.<br>
    <br>
    Ancient consciousness perceived spiritual powers directly manipulating physical objects, a concept foreign to
    scientific thought. However, this doesn&rsquo;t preclude the existence of spiritual beings in the heavenly realm
    whose activities are reflected in the earthly realm through participation. This allows us to maintain a biblical
    worldview while locating spiritual beings exclusively in the spiritual realm. Natural laws govern the material
    sphere, while mythic drama and conflict characterize the spiritual realm.<br>
    <br>
    The relationship between spiritual and material realms unfolds not through causation but through participation
    (<i>m&emacr;thexis</i>), where lower realities share in higher ones; what Plato designates as celestial archetypes
    or forms. This concept explains how the finite can relate to the infinite, bridging the divide between the
    transcendent and the immanent, and offering a framework for understanding the divine-human relationship.<br>
    <br>
    Crucially, participation implies an incomplete sharing or reflection; the lower does not fully contain the higher,
    but mirrors it in part. Christianity transformed the concept of participation into a foundational theological
    principle: while remaining distinct from God, creation derives its being through participation in heavenly life.
    This makes possible the promise of 2&#8239;Peter 1:4, that humans may become &ldquo;partakers of the divine
    nature.&rdquo; This finds tangible expression in sacramental participation, most especially in the Eucharist. By
    recognizing the interplay between spiritual and material realms, participation avoids rigid dualism yet preserves
    the distinct levels of reality in their proper hierarchical relationship.<br>
    <br>
    The late antique world existed as a realm where spiritual and material realities constantly intersected. Heavenly
    powers, angels, demons, and other spiritual beings were understood to permeate everyday life. The boundaries
    between natural and supernatural remained fluid, with spiritual forces believed to inhabit the air, influence human
    affairs, and manifest in physical phenomena. On the other hand, Old Testament scribes attributed all phenomena to
    Yahweh&rsquo;s direct action, including evil and destruction, which they understood as either divine punishment or
    tests of faith, reflecting their radical monotheistic worldview. As Aulén says:</p>
    <blockquote>
      Whereas in the Old Testament there are cases where the power symbols have been taken to mean that not only
      goodness but also evil have their origin in the divine will, in the New Testament God&rsquo;s power is set in
      radical opposition to every kind of evil&#8239;&mdash;&thinsp;and evil is linked with a power that is at an
      enmity with God. (Aulén, 1970b, p.&#8239;122)
    </blockquote>
    <p>The New Testament era witnessed a proliferation of spiritual beings and forces, leading to two contrasting
    outcomes: widespread superstitious practices on one hand, and a more sophisticated Platonic cosmology on the other.
    Philo&nbsp;of&nbsp;Alexandria, a Jewish-Platonic philosopher contemporary with Paul, developed an elaborate
    angelology. The texts familiar to Paul, such as the Book of Daniel, portrayed world conflicts as battles between
    angelic princes (10:13). The Book of 1&#8239;Enoch focused on the world&rsquo;s corruption by fallen angels and
    their divine punishment. R.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;Charles (1913) proposed that Paul used the &ldquo;Testaments of the Twelve
    Patriarchs&rdquo; as a reference text, which features angels, Satan, and the dark deity Beliar.<br>
    <br>
    Paul was deeply embedded in this spiritually charged culture, as evidenced in both his authentic letters and the
    deutero-Pauline and Pastoral Epistles: &ldquo;For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the
    rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in
    the heavenly realms&rdquo; (Eph. 6:12). First Timothy presents a complex spiritual cosmology populated by God,
    Christ, angels, Satan, and demons as active forces.<br>
    <br>
    This led to the articulation of a new soteriology through the lens of cosmic conflict. The early Christian
    understanding of salvation centered on Christ&rsquo;s cosmic victory over demonic powers. In this dramatic
    narrative, Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection represented not merely an atoning sacrifice, but a decisive
    military triumph over Satan and his fallen angels. This &ldquo;Christus Victor&rdquo; theme appears throughout
    early Christian texts.<br>
    <br>
    Through his death, Christ shattered Satan&rsquo;s legal authority over humanity, while the resurrection
    demonstrated Christ&rsquo;s supremacy over death and evil forces. The ascension marked Christ&rsquo;s triumph over
    the hostile &ldquo;powers and principalities,&rdquo; and his enthronement established sovereignty over all
    spiritual beings. Though the final eradication of evil and the ultimate defeat of death awaits the Parousia
    (1&#8239;Cor. 15:24), Christ&rsquo;s victory has already secured its ultimate outcome.<br>
    <br>
    The &ldquo;kingdom of God&rdquo; refers to the heavenly realm under Christ&rsquo;s eternal sovereignty.
    Paul&rsquo;s writings reveal not merely metaphorical references to spirits, but a comprehensive kingdom theology.
    Biblical narratives present Paul as one who performed exorcisms, undertook heavenly journeys, and possessed
    extraordinary insight into spiritual realities. For Paul, events in the material world derived their true
    significance from spiritual realities.<br>
    <br>
    In Second Corinthians 11:13-14, Paul denounces the &ldquo;super-apostles&rdquo; from Jerusalem: &ldquo;Such people
    are false apostles, deceitful workers, masquerading as apostles of Christ. And no wonder, for Satan himself
    masquerades as an angel of light.&rdquo; This reflects Paul&rsquo;s understanding that Satan, operating in the
    heavenly realm, was the true force behind these false apostles&rsquo; attempts to undermine his ministry.<br>
    <br>
    <span class="bigger">Dummling</span><br>
    <br>
    The kingdom of God exists in the realm of myth and fairy tale. The fairy tale dimension holds particular
    significance, as <span class="nobr">Marie-Louise von Franz</span> observes:</p>
    <blockquote>
      Fairy tales are the purest and simplest expression of collective unconscious psychic processes. Therefore their
      value for the scientific investigation of the unconscious exceeds that of all other material. They represent the
      archetypes in their simplest, barest, and most concise form. In this pure form, the archetypal images afford us
      the best clues to the understanding of the processes going on in the collective psyche. In myths or legends, or
      any other more elaborate mythological material, we get at the basic patterns of the human psyche through an
      overlay of cultural material. But in fairy tales there is much less specific conscious cultural material, and
      therefore they mirror the basic patterns of the psyche more clearly. (Von&nbsp;Franz, 1996, p.&#8239;15)
    </blockquote>
    <p>While von Franz conceptualizes these patterns through the lens of a &ldquo;collective unconscious&rdquo;
    populated by autonomous archetypes (a framework that cognitive science has since challenged; cf. Winther, 2022),
    the kingdom model locates these archetypal forces in the spiritual realm itself, the kingdom of God. Interestingly,
    Eriugena extensively uses <i>archetypus</i> in his translations of Pseudo-Dionysius and in his own theological
    works, particularly <i>Periphyseon</i>, where he discusses &ldquo;archetypal ideas&rdquo; (<i>ide&aelig;
    archetyp&aelig;</i>) in God&rsquo;s mind.<br>
    <br>
    Dummling is a particularly important archetype. He is typically the third and youngest son, dismissed by his family
    and society as simple-minded, foolish, or incapable. His name literally means &ldquo;little fool&rdquo; or
    &ldquo;simpleton&rdquo; in German. While appearing foolish to others, Dummling possesses a different kind of
    intelligence, which is often intuitive, spiritual, or emotional rather than conventional cleverness. He succeeds
    precisely because he doesn&rsquo;t overthink situations.<br>
    <br>
    Unlike his supposedly smarter brothers, Dummling consistently shows kindness to strangers, animals, and those in
    need. This generosity becomes the key to his eventual success. Rather than using cunning or force like his
    brothers, Dummling approaches challenges with simplicity, honesty, and often accidental wisdom that reveals deeper
    truths.<br>
    <br>
    Dummling represents the archetype of the &ldquo;wise fool&rdquo; who reveals the folly of conventional wisdom. His
    apparent simplicity masks profound insight. In many tales, Dummling&rsquo;s journey represents a spiritual path
    where humility, compassion, and faith lead to enlightenment or reward. In &ldquo;The Golden Goose,&rdquo; Dummling
    shares his meager meal with a grey old man and receives magical help. In &ldquo;The Three Feathers,&rdquo; his
    apparent randomness in following a feather leads him to the right path while his calculating brothers fail.<br>
    <br>
    Dummling typically transforms from social outcast to hero, often winning a princess or kingdom, but the victory
    comes through moral rather than intellectual superiority. The Dummling represents the triumph of heart over head,
    suggesting that authenticity and compassion are more valuable than cunning or book learning. Von&nbsp;Franz says
    that the Dummling story &ldquo;compensates the conscious attitude of a society in which patriarchal schemes and
    oughts and shoulds dominate. It is ruled by rigid principles because of which the irrational, spontaneous
    adaptation to events is lost&rdquo; (von&nbsp;Franz, 1996, p.&#8239;64).<br>
    <br>
    Hubertus Halbfas (referencing Günter Lange, 1982) highlights two parallels between fairy tales and Christian
    faith:</p>
    <blockquote>
      First, the fairy tale hero who, while dependent on help, is blessed with gifts and acts through the power of
      their charisma. Second, redemption as a central theme in both fairy tales and Christian faith. However, just as
      Lange introduces this concept, he withdraws it, noting that &lsquo;redemption&rsquo; has become an empty phrase
      in modern discourse. Yet it might be valuable to revisit the theological concept through the lens of how
      redemption is understood in certain fairy tales. Further connections between fairy tales and Christianity appear
      in the theme of the lowly being elevated. The Dummling figure can also be seen as parallel to Gospel narratives.
      And as Chesterton observes, Cinderella&rsquo;s truth mirrors that of the Magnificat: <i>exaltavit humiles</i> (he
      has exalted the humble).<br>
      [&hellip;]<br>
      Dummling, when recognized through his many manifestations, emerges as an especially complex character who shares
      characteristics with the holy fool found in the Gospel and, subsequently, in the tradition of Fools for Christ.
      Through the figure of Dummling, fairy tales teach &ldquo;purity of heart&rdquo;; his seeming unworldliness
      ultimately reveals itself as a higher wisdom, one that is &ldquo;hidden from the wise and learned, and revealed
      to little children&rdquo; (Luke 10:21). (Halbfas, 2012, ch.&#8239;II:2)
    </blockquote>
    <p>Thus, Jesus&rsquo;s otherworldly teachings merit examination through the lens of Dummling foolishness. Some
    scholars see a development in Jesus&rsquo;s understanding of his mission, marked by the shift from an initially
    triumphant messianic ministry in Galilee to the recognition that he must suffer in Jerusalem. According to this
    interpretation, Jesus had expected that the disciples&rsquo; successful exorcisms and healings would herald the
    imminent arrival of the kingdom (Mark 6:30; Luke 9:10, 10:17-24). When the kingdom failed to materialize as
    anticipated, Jesus reconsidered his approach and realized he must pursue a radical alternative strategy. This
    realization prompted his decisive departure from Caesarea Philippi towards Jerusalem. Through his death and
    resurrection, he would accomplish the definitive defeat of Satan, since death (the ultimate consequence of sin
    under Satan&rsquo;s dominion) would thereby be conquered (Matthew 16:21; Mark 8:31; Luke 9:22).<br>
    <br>
    The notion of death as both conquerable and a result of sin represents a transcendent, kingdom-based truth rather
    than an earthly reality. Biologically, death is essential for life on Earth to exist. Pagan religions, by contrast,
    forge a stronger connection between earthly and heavenly realms. Their concept of the Mother of Life and Death
    embodies this natural cycle, making paganism more aligned with biological reality.<br>
    <br>
    Christianity departed from earth-centered religions by embracing transcendent truths that defied natural reality.
    The philosophers at the Areopagus (Acts 17:16-34) found several Christian doctrines inconceivable: a perfect,
    deathless original state that fell into corruption, God taking human form, physical resurrection of the body, death
    as unnatural rather than part of nature&rsquo;s cycle, and creation <i>ex nihilo</i>. Their derision of
    Paul&rsquo;s teaching would later prompt him to write:</p>
    <blockquote>
      The person without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God but considers them
      foolishness, and cannot understand them because they are discerned only through the Spirit. (1&#8239;Cor.
      2:14)<br>
      <br>
      For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the
      power of God. (1:18)<br>
      <br>
      Let no one deceive himself. If any of you thinks he is wise in this age, he should become a fool, so that he may
      become wise. For the wisdom of this world is foolishness in God&rsquo;s sight. As it is written: &ldquo;He
      catches the wise in their craftiness.&rdquo; And again, &ldquo;The Lord knows that the thoughts of the wise are
      futile.&rdquo; (3:18-20)<br>
      <br>
      For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not know him, God was pleased through the
      foolishness of what was preached to save those who believe. (1:21)<br>
      <br>
      But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise; God chose the weak things of the world to shame
      the strong. (1:27)<br>
      <br>
      And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing. The god of this age has blinded the
      minds of unbelievers, so that they cannot see the light of the gospel that displays the glory of Christ, who is
      the image of God. (2&#8239;Cor. 4:3-4)
    </blockquote>
    <p>Jesus&rsquo;s understanding that his death, resurrection, and ascension to the heavenly throne would defeat
    Satan reflects otherworldly truth. These events belong to the eternal reality of God&rsquo;s kingdom, transcending
    earthly logic. Their meaning becomes accessible only through the framework of myth and fairy tale, where Dummling
    wisdom prevails. Like Dummling&rsquo;s skeptical brothers in fairy tales, the disciples dismissed Jesus&rsquo;s
    plan as foolishness, unable to take his words seriously. Yet, just as Dummling triumphs in folk stories, Jesus
    emerged victorious, transforming world history. What explains this paradoxical success?<br>
    <br>
    While theological understanding illuminates the heavenly events, historical details remain less certain. Following
    the principle of participation, earthly events partially reflected the mythic realities of God&rsquo;s kingdom. On
    the road to Emmaus (Luke 24:13-35), two disciples walked with a stranger who bore no resemblance to Jesus in
    appearance, gait, or speech. Yet in the familiar gesture of breaking bread, their eyes were opened, and they
    recognized him as the risen Christ. Like Dummling in fairy tales, Jesus had taught them to see beyond appearances
    and embrace a deeper faith.<br>
    <br>
    The power of the spiritual realm acts like a magnet beneath a sheet of paper, where iron filings above align
    themselves with invisible magnetic forces, creating a pattern that imperfectly mirrors transcendent reality.<br>
    <br>
    <span class="bigger">Gustaf Aulén</span><br>
    <br>
    Gustaf Aulén (Swedish bishop, 1879&#8239;&ndash;&thinsp;1977), in his landmark work &ldquo;Christus Victor&rdquo;
    (1931), revived the Christus Victor view, which had dominated early Christianity for over a millennium. The idea of
    a transaction with the devil has faced strong criticism among modern theologians; yet it was firmly established in
    the early Church, and consistently appears in the Fathers, such as Irenaeus, Origen, Ambrose, Augustine, and
    Gregory the Great.<br>
    <br>
    This perspective sees Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection primarily as a cosmic victory over evil powers (death,
    sin, and the devil) rather than as a legal transaction or moral example. In this understanding, humanity was held
    captive by hostile spiritual forces until Christ&rsquo;s triumph liberated it (Aulén, 1970a). Thus, it represents
    not a rational theory but a mythic drama encompassing both atonement and salvation. While Aulén himself considered
    it all-sufficient, it requires complementary rational frameworks. This explains why both Paul and Luther, though
    emphasizing Christus Victor, also employed substitutionary atonement.<br>
    <br>
    Aulén emphasizes that &ldquo;symbol language is the mother tongue of faith&rdquo; (1970b, p.&#8239;89). Whatever we
    say about God must be said in the form of symbols. He concludes that &ldquo;There are dimensions, there are
    spiritual realities which cannot be referred to and explained except through symbols&rdquo; (p.&#8239;117). This
    intimate connection between faith and symbolic expression explains faith&rsquo;s central role in Christian
    religion. Addressing the dramatic context of the Bible, Aulén writes:</p>
    <blockquote>
      To regard what the Bible says about heaven&#8239;&ndash;&thinsp;God &ldquo;who is in heaven,&rdquo; Christ
      &ldquo;sitting at the right hand of God&rdquo;&#8239;&mdash;&thinsp;as just nothing but meaningless mythology,
      reveals the same high degree of incomprehension of the mother tongue of faith, symbol language, as trying to take
      these expressions in a literal and localized sense. (p.&#8239;151)
    </blockquote>
    <p>While Aulén interprets religious symbols existentially (seeing resurrection, for example, as transition to
    authentic life), this approach proves unconvincing (p.&#8239;175). A Platonic realist interpretation better
    accounts for the phenomena: Christ&rsquo;s continued existence in God&rsquo;s kingdom serves as the basis for his
    existential impact on believers.<br>
    <br>
    Aulén sharply criticizes theologians who reject the notion of God as a distinct being. These theologians instead
    claim God is not merely the highest being but rather &ldquo;Being itself&rdquo; and &ldquo;the ground of
    Being.&rdquo; This formulation appears obscure and contradictory, using the word &ldquo;being&rdquo; in two
    incompatible senses. Moreover, this concept of God as &ldquo;Being itself&rdquo; (regardless of how one interprets
    the phrase) finds little support in the Christian message (pp.&#8239;93-94).<br>
    <br>
    The kingdom model resolves this theological dilemma by showing how God can both exist as a being in the heavenly
    realm and transcend heaven and earth as Being itself. Yet the crucial focus remains on God&rsquo;s dramatic
    involvement within heaven, not on abstract concepts of divine transcendence.<br>
    <br>
    Aulén discusses the conundrum that the classic view of atonement exhibits a crucial double aspect, an inherent
    tension which makes a fully rational theory of atonement difficult (1970a, pp.&#8239;55ff). On one level, it
    presents a dualistic conflict between God and evil powers. However, these hostile powers paradoxically serve as
    agents of God&rsquo;s judgment on sin. They are both enemies and instruments of punishing divine justice.<br>
    <br>
    This double aspect appears in several ways. God both authors and receives reconciliation. Christ&rsquo;s suffering
    fulfills both divine punishment and liberation. The divine law itself exemplifies this duality in Paul&rsquo;s
    thought: it is both &ldquo;holy and righteous&rdquo; yet also a &ldquo;hostile power&rdquo; from which Christ
    redeems us: &ldquo;The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law&rdquo; (1&#8239;Cor. 15:56).<br>
    <br>
    This double aspect becomes clearer through kingdom theology, where the celestial drama functions as the necessary
    means for accomplishing redemption. The law operates as a demonic and oppressive power within the kingdom, destined
    for defeat by Christ in the theo-drama orchestrated by the transcendent Godhead for humanity&rsquo;s salvation.<br>
    <br>
    Thus, the tyrants embody God&rsquo;s judgment on sin, yet are overcome through Christ&rsquo;s sacrifice. Though
    this cosmic theo-drama appears dualistic, ultimate authority resides with God as its sovereign author. In the
    monistic dimension, the law is holy and righteous; in the dualistic dimension, it is a hostile power.<br>
    <br>
    By viewing God&rsquo;s engagement with the world as a mythical and transformative narrative, this approach
    addresses the problem of evil not by eliminating its existence, but by redefining its role within the cosmic story.
    Evil becomes part of a larger process of conflict, suffering, and ultimately, transformation, a process in which
    God, as a suffering and conflicted presence, shares in the efforts to overcome darkness and foster renewal.<br>
    <br>
    While modern rationalistic theology has severely damaged Christianity, Aulén&rsquo;s work uniquely preserves the
    kingdom perspective central to Jesus and Paul.<br>
    <br>
    <span class="bigger">Eliade</span><br>
    <br>
    Mircea Eliade (Romanian historian of religion, 1907&#8239;&ndash;&thinsp;1986) observes that traditional societies
    derive all significant acts from mythical prototypes, whether it concerns building, hunting, healing, or suffering.
    Archaic man &ldquo;acknowledges no act which has not been previously posited and lived by someone else, some other
    being who was not a man. What he does has been done before. His life is the ceaseless repetition of gestures
    initiated by others&rdquo; (Eliade, 1959a, p.&#8239;5).<br>
    <br>
    This suggests humans naturally orient themselves through narrative patterns rather than abstract principles. Eliade
    has found that traditional societies experience myths as more real than everyday existence, because myths reveal
    eternal patterns while daily life merely repeats and decays. This parallels the Platonic framework of kingdom
    theology, where mythic patterns in God&rsquo;s mind possess greater reality than their material manifestations.
    Indeed, Eliade explicitly recognizes the fundamentally Platonic structure of the primitive or archaic worldview
    (p.&#8239;34).<br>
    <br>
    Significantly, Eliade resists any psychologization of the divine and aligns his use of &lsquo;archetype&rsquo; with
    Augustine&rsquo;s understanding; as &lsquo;exemplary model&rsquo; or &lsquo;paradigm&rsquo; (p.&#8239;ix).
    Eliade&rsquo;s vast documentation of humanity&rsquo;s mythical consciousness across cultures and millennia suggests
    that the kingdom model recovers something essential that modern theology has forgotten: the sacred is known through
    symbolic participation, not rational analysis.<br>
    <br>
    Eliade&rsquo;s concept of sacred time (the time of primordial plenitude&#8239;&mdash;&thinsp;<i>in illo
    tempore</i>, <i>illud tempus</i>; &ldquo;those days&rdquo;) parallels the distinction between linear temporal
    reality and the kingdom&rsquo;s circular, mythic time. This parallel extends to his observation that religious
    rituals enable participants to transcend profane time and enter eternal primordial time (pp.&#8239;20-22, 112,
    121).<br>
    <br>
    The notion that myths are neither static blueprints nor mere past events, but eternally recurring patterns that
    remain dynamically present, supports reconceptualizing Platonic forms as living narratives rather than frozen
    concepts. The cosmic cycles Eliade documents across cultures, which involve creation, destruction and renewal,
    emerge not as primitive misunderstandings but as authentic glimpses into the circular time of God&rsquo;s
    kingdom.<br>
    <br>
    The kingdom model finds crucial support in Eliade&rsquo;s distinction between cosmic Christianity, which emphasizes
    nature&rsquo;s sanctification and mythic consciousness, and historical Christianity, which prioritizes linear time
    and historical events. His analysis of how western Christianity abandoned cosmic for historical consciousness
    illuminates modern theology&rsquo;s difficulty in grasping the kingdom as mythic reality.<br>
    <br>
    Early Christianity, as Eliade demonstrates, originally maintained both historical and mythical dimensions in
    creative tension. In documenting the &ldquo;cosmic Christ&rdquo; of Eastern Orthodoxy and folk Christianity, Eliade
    reveals the very paradigm we seek to recover: Christ as eternal mythical pattern actively present in God&rsquo;s
    kingdom, transcending mere historical manifestation. Eliade writes:</p>
    <blockquote>
      In a summary formula we might say that for the nonreligious men of the modern age, the cosmos has become opaque,
      inert, mute; it transmits no message, it holds no cipher. The feeling of the sanctity of nature survives today in
      Europe chiefly among rural populations, for it is among them that a Christianity lived as a cosmic liturgy still
      exists.<br>
      <br>
      As for the Christianity of the industrial societies and especially the Christianity of intellectuals, it has long
      since lost the cosmic values that it still possessed in the Middle Ages. We must add that this does not
      necessarily imply that urban Christianity is deteriorated or inferior, but only that the religious sense of urban
      populations is gravely impoverished. The cosmic liturgy, the mystery of nature&rsquo;s participation in the
      Christological drama, have become inaccessible to Christians living in a modern city. Their religious experience
      is no longer open to the cosmos. In the last analysis, it is a strictly private experience; salvation is a
      problem that concerns man and his god; at most, man recognizes that he is responsible not only to God but also to
      history. But in these man-God-history relationships there is no place for the cosmos. From this it would appear
      that, even for a genuine Christian, the world is no longer felt as the work of God. (Eliade, 1959b,
      pp.&#8239;178-79)
    </blockquote>
    <p>Eliade&rsquo;s analysis illuminates Jesus&rsquo;s own mission: through his kingdom concept, Jesus sought to
    restore the cosmic dimension of traditional religion, countering the spiritual aridity of his era&rsquo;s religious
    institutions&#8239;&mdash;&thinsp;a pattern that parallels our modern challenge.<br>
    <br>
    <span class="bigger">Divine Guidance</span><br>
    <br>
    What purpose underlies God&rsquo;s creation of a celestial realm where angelic forces engage in perpetual conflict?
    The spiritual world serves as a dynamic pattern shaping physical reality, like a choreographer&rsquo;s vision
    guiding dancers. This divine template operates actively, establishing principles that material existence follows,
    though imperfectly.<br>
    <br>
    Worldly events manifest as expressions of spiritual forces, as waves reveal underlying currents. Nothing in
    physical reality remains static; all matter follows patterns reflecting spiritual movements. Reality thus unfolds
    hierarchically, with worldly events expressing spiritual principles. The material realm doesn&rsquo;t merely
    replicate the spiritual; it participates in and manifests these patterns, though always with natural
    limitations.<br>
    <br>
    This dynamic nature becomes evident in moral decisions. It would be misguided to view God&rsquo;s law as a set of
    rigid, unchanging rules for conduct. Right and wrong often depend on context, which explains why both Jesus and
    Paul emphasized the law&rsquo;s secondary importance. While the law remains valid, it allows for exceptions based
    on circumstances. Divine guidance emerges not as doctrinal dictation but as an invitation into God&rsquo;s
    narrative imagination. Narrative transcends legalism&#8239;&mdash;&thinsp;Heaven offers guidance through drama
    rather than rules.<br>
    <br>
    Jesus exemplifies this through Sabbath healing (Mark 3:1-6), affirming that &ldquo;the Sabbath was made for man,
    not man for the Sabbath.&rdquo; Paul develops this theme, proclaiming that, through Christ, we have freedom from
    slavery under the law (Gal. 5:1-6). Thus, he reveals love as the law&rsquo;s fulfillment (Romans 13:8-10) and his
    wisdom continues to shine: &ldquo;The letter kills, but the Spirit gives life&rdquo; (2&#8239;Cor. 3:6).<br>
    <br>
    If God exists in complete self-sufficiency, divine guidance reduces to mere unilateral decrees from an unaffected
    source. Yet this view falters when confronted with the mythic kingdom. We cannot reason purely in terms of divine
    self-sufficiency, as this isolates God from the very conflicts that define his narrative themes. Rather, we must
    envision God as a suffering deity, intimately engaged in the kingdom&rsquo;s strife. Within the kingdom narrative,
    God&rsquo;s power operates not as absolute omnipotence.<br>
    <br>
    God&rsquo;s essential nature (wholly good, self-sufficient, independent, and self-existent) would have remained
    separate from our dynamic world. Therefore, God created through the Son a dynamic spiritual realm that bridges this
    gap, enabling material creation to participate in heavenly life. The universe&rsquo;s dynamic character requires
    opposing forces in tension with each other, accounting for the presence of malevolent spiritual powers. As a
    spiritual principle, chaos serves divine purpose rather than equaling the power of God.<br>
    <br>
    However, the moral status of any particular angel isn&rsquo;t fixed absolutely, but depends on context. Even the
    devil can serve good purposes, as traditional fairy tales demonstrate. Though fundamentally malevolent, the devil
    occasionally helps humans, either through binding contracts or by unwittingly advancing good outcomes. His strict
    adherence to rules and agreements often allows clever heroes to outwit him.<br>
    <br>
    The crucial insight is that good and evil lack absolute definitions in our world. Actions that seem beneficial can
    yield harmful results, and apparent evils sometimes produce good. Moreover, success doesn&rsquo;t always come
    through rationality, cunning, or principled thinking alone. Instead, we must remain open to heavenly inspiration,
    the kind of spiritual wisdom that Dummling embodies through his simple but powerful faith.<br>
    <br>
    Coleridge defines sin as allowing our practical intellect (Understanding) to operate without the guidance of higher
    wisdom (Reason), which is ultimately divine (cf. Swiatecka, 1980, p.&#8239;49). Had pure reason been sufficient to
    guide humanity, the world&rsquo;s intellectuals would have established Utopia centuries ago. The
    Enlightenment&rsquo;s brightest minds couldn&rsquo;t reason their way to perfect solutions. Rational utopian
    experiments have ended in disaster.<br>
    <br>
    Divine guidance emerges not as a detached, aseitic process but as one anchored in God&rsquo;s creative deployment
    of mythic themes within a dynamic, conflicted kingdom, akin to the ancient Egyptian Duat. Within divine
    consciousness, God generates and orchestrates mythic themes that constitute the very fabric of the kingdom. This
    kingdom is not a static paradise but a dynamic realm of conflict and trial, strikingly similar to the
    Duat&#8239;&mdash;&thinsp;the spirit world where souls navigated perils, gods clashed, and cosmic order was forged
    through struggle.<br>
    <br>
    Divine guidance is not imposed from on high but woven from the mythical narratives God creates to engage with
    creation. Invented themes are not mere metaphors but equal to the kingdom itself, demanding that we reimagine God
    not as an impassive sovereign but as a participant in the very battles that shape reality. This accords with the
    biblical witness.<br>
    <br>
    Mythology and fairy tale, far from being a human fabrication, originates in the divine intellect. God, as the
    ultimate storyteller, conjures archetypes, narratives, and symbols (heroes&rsquo; journeys, cosmic battles,
    redemptive sacrifices) that serve as the building blocks of guidance. These are not arbitrary; they are invented in
    God&rsquo;s mind, emerging from divine creativity to bridge the gap between the infinite and the finite.<br>
    <br>
    Biblical themes, such as Expulsion from Paradise, Flood, Exodus, Wilderness wandering, Conquest of Canaan, Passion
    of Christ, are not historical accidents but mythic themes God employs to guide humanity. These events mirror
    universal patterns (death and rebirth, exile and return) that God invents to communicate purpose. In this view,
    divine guidance is mythological at its core: God reveals Himself through stories that invite participation, not
    passive reception. Crucially, there is no opposition between history and symbol, as Coleridge argues: &ldquo;Why
    not at once symbol and history?&rdquo; (Coleridge, 1884, p.&#8239;270). As Swiatecka explains:</p>
    <blockquote>
      There are at least some instances where the terms &lsquo;history&rsquo; and &lsquo;symbol&rsquo; are not opposed
      in this way. Thus D.&nbsp;G.&nbsp;James, interpreting Coleridge, says: &ldquo;Not only is the symbol not a
      &lsquo;mere symbol&rsquo;; it is also event. If the symbol is &lsquo;consubstantial with the truth of which it is
      the conductor,&rsquo; it is also embedded in, or rather is a part of, history.&rdquo; (Swiatecka, 1980,
      p.&#8239;21)
    </blockquote>
    <p>History can embody heavenly meaning, which explains how the kingdom of God intersects with actual historical
    events. However, the conflict takes place <i>within</i> the kingdom of God, which is the mythical realm of
    God&rsquo;s mind. Here, God contends with chaos, symbolized by sin, doubt, or cosmic disorder, not as an external
    foe but as an internal dynamic.<br>
    <br>
    In this way God reveals himself through stories of struggle and suffering, like those of the prodigal son and Job.
    These narratives show that God is not detached from creation but deeply connected to it, experiencing conflict
    alongside us. His guidance comes not from remote authority but from shared experience, making theology more
    meaningful than mere abstract doctrine. It humanizes the divine without diminishing it, urging us to participate in
    the kingdom&rsquo;s myths, where even destruction is a divine pattern. The anthropocentric biblical stories regain
    their authority. Taking mythology seriously isn&rsquo;t a primitive anthropomorphism but rather recognition of the
    fundamentally narrative structure of heavenly reality itself.<br>
    <br>
    In this sense, divine guidance is less about providing clear answers and more about equipping humanity to engage in
    the cosmic drama alongside God. In traditional theology, God&rsquo;s aseity is often emphasized, depicting God as a
    self-sufficient, all-powerful being who exists independently of human experience. However, this perspective
    overlooks the complexities of divine guidance, where God&rsquo;s involvement in human affairs implies a more
    nuanced and dynamic relationship.<br>
    <br>
    <span class="bigger">Theological Considerations</span><br></p>
    <p class="centered"><br>
    <span class="bigger">1.</span></p>
    <p>The kingdom model allows us to reinterpret seemingly implausible biblical events as occurrences in the heavenly
    realm. For instance, the apocalyptic visions in Revelation and the Flood narrative may represent celestial rather
    than terrestrial events. Though earthly catastrophes may reflect heavenly dramas, literal interpretations of these
    accounts generate both scientific skepticism and profound theological questions regarding divine nature, as such
    interpretations conflict with the concept of divine mercy.<br>
    <br>
    These cataclysmic events unfold within the spirit world as actual occurrences with metaphorical dimensions,
    resolving cosmic drama and enabling new creation. By locating divine violence exclusively within mythic reality
    rather than material history, we may resolve one of theology&rsquo;s most agonizing problems while preserving the
    biblical witness to God as divine warrior.<br>
    <br>
    In the material world, violence emerges from sin, disorder, and creaturely rebellion, but never from God&rsquo;s
    direct will or nature. God operates within creation through providence, natural law, and human agency, whereas
    violence manifests as a disruption of the created order, shaped by evolutionary processes, not divine action. When
    humans commit violence, even claiming divine sanction, they act from their fallen nature rather than as instruments
    of divine will. This does not preclude that violence may be necessary in a fallen world.<br>
    <br>
    In the kingdom&rsquo;s mythical reality, divine action against chaos operates by entirely different principles.
    This force differs fundamentally from violence as we experience it, representing instead the eternal ordering of
    chaos, defeat of evil, and establishment of cosmos. It functions as a structural element of reality itself,
    analogous to light dispelling darkness or form organizing matter. Such mythical power generates rather than
    destroys, creating space for life rather than dealing death.<br>
    <br>
    This explains why biblical descriptions of divine violence often feel mythical rather than historical even when
    attached to historical events. The conquest of Canaan, the Flood, the Egyptian plagues&#8239;&mdash;&thinsp;as
    historical events, these involve human violence and natural disaster within fallen creation. But as mythic
    patterns, they narrate God&rsquo;s eternal victory over chaos, the establishment of sacred order, the liberation
    from oppressive powers. Yahweh&rsquo;s battle against Leviathan, Marduk&rsquo;s defeat of Tiamat, Christ&rsquo;s
    harrowing of hell&#8239;&mdash;&thinsp;these mythical victories reveal God&rsquo;s eternal nature as
    chaos-defeater.<br>
    <br>
    Mythologically, the cross manifests as God&rsquo;s definitive conquest of chaos: death vanquished, Satan subdued,
    and cosmic powers disarmed. The resurrection reveals divine violence as life-generating rather than destructive.
    Thus, historical events serve as revelatory vehicles for eternal patterns without implying direct divine causation
    of temporal violence.<br>
    <br>
    The principle of symbolic participation suggests these accounts contain historical truth, as conflict inheres in
    nature itself. Christ&rsquo;s life, however, achieved the perfect synthesis of symbolic myth and human history,
    where eternal and temporal realms fully converge.<br>
    <br>
    Theodicy need not justify God&rsquo;s participation in historic atrocities or natural disasters. There is no need
    to defend God&rsquo;s involvement in historical violence or natural evil. Earthquakes, diseases, and human
    atrocities emerge from creation&rsquo;s material conditions and creaturely freedom rather than divine will. While
    God permits these events within creation&rsquo;s autonomy, divine agency does not cause them. Simultaneously, at
    the eternal level, God wages perpetual war against the chaos these evils represent, establishing order against
    disorder, life against death, and meaning against absurdity.<br>
    <br>
    The distinction helps address religious violence. When believers commit violence claiming divine mandate, they
    catastrophically confuse heavenly and material realities. They attempt to enact through historical violence what
    God accomplishes through mythical victory. This category confusion underlies religious terrorism, crusades, and
    holy wars. True participation in mythic victory occurs through prayer, virtue, and self-sacrifice, but not through
    wielding weapons.</p>
    <p class="centered"><span class="bigger">2.</span></p>
    <p>The kingdom&rsquo;s circular narrative time enables mythic renewal through cosmic purgation. The distinction
    between sacred and linear time is essential for understanding the cosmos. The material realm&rsquo;s linear
    temporality facilitates authentic history, moral development, and the irreversible progression essential for
    meaningful redemption. In this temporal realm, past sins necessitate future salvation, causation flows
    unidirectionally, and both progress and regress remain possible. In contrast, circular time in the kingdom
    manifests eternal recurrence of mythic patterns: the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world, the perpetual
    victory over chaos, the ever-present &lsquo;once upon a time&rsquo; of mythic drama.<br>
    <br>
    This temporal duality explains the dual function of biblical narrative as both historical record and mythic
    pattern. The Exodus occurred once in linear time yet exists eternally in God&rsquo;s kingdom. Christ&rsquo;s
    resurrection, singular in historical time, represents perpetual victory over death in mythic reality. Similarly,
    the Church progresses through linear history while simultaneously reigning with Christ in circular eternity.<br>
    <br>
    The mythic world reveals suffering as inherently woven into cycles of death, transformation, and renewal, rather
    than as isolated, purposeless experience. The Phoenix myth and Inanna&rsquo;s descent exemplify how decay and
    adversity catalyze the emergence of new life and insight. This cyclical understanding continues to shape modern
    thought, suggesting periods of hardship serve as crucibles for personal and societal regeneration rather than
    markers of ultimate failure or divine punishment.<br>
    <br>
    Mythical narratives frame suffering through archetypal patterns and cyclical transformation, placing individual
    hardships within a cosmic narrative. This reframing imbues painful struggles with transcendent purpose,
    transforming existential angst into catalysts for renewal. Thus the temporal and heavenly realms interweave,
    temporarily dissolving their apparent separation.</p>
    <p class="centered"><span class="bigger">3.</span></p>
    <p>The temporal distinction reveals a deeper metaphysical truth: the temporal world exhibits monistic unity, while
    the heavenly realm manifests essential duality. Mythologies often present dualities as interconnected forces: light
    and dark, life and death, order and chaos.<br>
    <br>
    The interplay of unity and duality forms a fundamental cosmic principle. The monistic nature of material reality
    manifests in the created order emanating from divine will. Within this order, evil exists as privation, chaos as
    derivative, and all existence participates in a heavenly goodness that serves to maintain creation. Yet the
    kingdom&rsquo;s dualism reveals that opposition manifests as both authentic and essential within divine
    consciousness. This represents not a Manichaean dualism of equal forces, but rather a &ldquo;dramatic
    dualism&rdquo; in which divine will reveals itself through necessary opposition.<br>
    <br>
    This paradigm resolves apparent paradoxes in sacred texts: Isaiah&rsquo;s declaration of God creating evil (Isaiah
    45:7), Job&rsquo;s Satan among the divine council (Job 1:6), and Revelation&rsquo;s celestial warfare. These
    manifestations express the kingdom&rsquo;s dualistic mythic patterns rather than creation&rsquo;s unified order.
    The kingdom of God thus encompasses the complete dramatic spectrum necessary for its self-revelation.<br>
    <br>
    Divine impassibility and passibility no longer conflict: God is impassible regarding created reality but passible
    within the spirit world. Sovereignty and openness both hold: absolute in relation to creation, dynamic in relation
    to chaos. Transcendence and immanence coincide: God transcends material reality while the kingdom&rsquo;s mythic
    patterns influence all existence.<br>
    <br>
    God&rsquo;s relationship to violence fundamentally differs across these realms. In material creation, God opposes
    all violence as disorder and sin. In mythic reality, God eternally &lsquo;violates&rsquo; chaos to establish
    cosmos. This distinction preserves both divine goodness and biblical realism about divine warfare. The God who
    commands &ldquo;thou shalt not kill&rdquo; in history is the same God who slays the dragon in eternity; different
    realms, different rules, same divine nature expressed appropriately to each.<br>
    <br>
    This framework achieves what centuries of theodicy could not: affirming God as warrior while denying God&rsquo;s
    complicity in historical violence, preserving biblical narrative while maintaining ethical sophistication, enabling
    spiritual warfare while promoting material peacemaking. The price is accepting a fundamental dualism between
    material and mythic reality; but this price purchases theological coherence previously unattainable.</p>
    <p class="centered"><span class="bigger">4.</span></p>
    <p>The kingdom paradigm reveals how mythic consciousness, properly understood, serves as the cure for superstition
    rather than its cause&#8239;&mdash;&thinsp;a profound reversal of Enlightenment assumptions. By distinguishing
    between temporal and heavenly realities, mythical thinking enhances rather than diminishes practical
    rationality.<br>
    <br>
    Superstition fundamentally involves category confusion; applying mythical causation to material events or expecting
    material causation to operate in mythic realms. One who attributes illness to divine punishment conflates judicial
    mythic frameworks with natural causation, failing to differentiate between these distinct realities.<br>
    <br>
    Mythic consciousness, far from encouraging superstition, offers its only cure. Superstition thrives in the twilight
    zone between realms, generating category errors that produce both bad religion and bad science. Clear mythical
    thinking banishes this twilight, illuminating each realm with its proper light. In daily life, we can be utterly
    practical about worldly matters precisely because we remain utterly convinced of mythical truths.<br>
    <br>
    Contemporary reduction of God&rsquo;s kingdom to mere social phenomena epitomizes this superstitious conflation of
    ontological levels. The world progresses not towards a temporal kingdom of God but towards the continued unfolding
    of creation. The goal is not earthly Utopia but sustained creation. Fulfillment belongs to God&rsquo;s kingdom
    alone, not to the worldly realm.<br>
    <br>
    Superstition either attributes all suffering to divine punishment or expects faith to eliminate suffering entirely.
    Mythic consciousness, however, recognizes suffering as inherent to material reality while simultaneously
    participating in divine victory over suffering. We use medicine for disease while praying for healing, not because
    prayer magically enhances medicine, but because healing manifests through distinct patterns at different levels of
    reality.<br>
    <br>
    Without mythic consciousness, religion degenerates into mere morality or philosophy, forfeiting its transformative
    power. The kingdom of God, stripped of its mythic imagery, diminishes to an ethical ideal rather than remaining a
    living reality into which one might enter. While Satan and the angels warrant demythologization as metaphysical
    entities in temporal reality, they retain their mythical authenticity within the kingdom of God, where the
    tripartite cosmic structure endures.</p>
    <p class="centered"><span class="bigger">5.</span></p>
    <p>The sacred-material dialectic illuminates sacramental theology by bridging heavenly and physical realms without
    conflating them. The Eucharist manifests bread&rsquo;s participation in Christ&rsquo;s self-giving patterns,
    transcending mere molecular transformation, while Baptism initiates one into death-resurrection mythology rather
    than mechanically cleansing. This preserves both sacramental power and ontological distinction, avoiding both
    materialist superstition and rationalist reduction.<br>
    <br>
    In Christological terms, Christ emerges as the protagonist of the heavenly narrative through incarnation in
    temporal reality. Christ thus embodies both the eternal theo-drama and its historical actuality, being fully
    heavenly myth and fully human history, without compromising either.<br>
    <br>
    The kingdom paradigm, introduced by Jesus, has been impoverished by modern theology. In its original form, it
    revitalizes faith, transforming it from propositional assent into dynamic consciousness. Faith evolves from passive
    acceptance into imaginative engagement, awakening to myths as vessels of truth. It becomes humanity&rsquo;s living
    response to mythical creation, enabling authentic participation in the kingdom&rsquo;s theo-drama.<br>
    <br>
    Divine knowledge emerges through narrative immersion rather than abstraction. Faith requires engaging these
    narratives as participatory realities, experiencing the kingdom&rsquo;s struggles between justice and oppression as
    immediate, present actualities. Faith thus manifests as a perceptual mode, viewing reality through mythical rather
    than merely empirical or rational lenses. Unlike modern consciousness, which privileges literal fact and logical
    proposition, mythic consciousness finds true meaning only in mythic narrative patterns.<br>
    <br>
    Faith development entails cultivating the capacity to perceive and participate in reality&rsquo;s mythical
    dimensions. Rational apologetics often fails to spark genuine conversion since faith, as mythic consciousness,
    transcends mere logical acceptance. Authentic conversion requires consciousness transformation: learning to see
    through mythical eyes. Such transformation occurs through sacred story encounters, ritual participation, or
    mystical experience, which all engage symbolic imagination beyond rational intellect. Doubt, on the other hand,
    manifests not primarily as questioning historical facts or logical coherence, but as the dimming of mythic
    consciousness, the waning ability to perceive reality&rsquo;s mythical dimensions.</p>
    <p class="centered"><span class="bigger">6.</span></p>
    <p>Satan and chaos operate distinctly across different ontological levels. In material existence, Satan manifests
    as corruption, a privation of good demanding juridical remedy. In the kingdom of God, however, chaos emerges as
    something more primordial: the necessary &lsquo;other&rsquo; against which heavenly order defines itself, darkness
    rendering light visible, resistance enabling divine victory. This dualism maintains asymmetry as chaos serves
    divine purpose rather than presenting genuine rivalry to God&rsquo;s power. God remains the sovereign author.<br>
    <br>
    Kingdom theology reveals multiple theological dimensions operating simultaneously. Linear history demands concepts
    of aseity, sovereignty, and substitutional atonement in addressing sin, suffering, and salvation. Myth, ritual, and
    vision reveal to us the cosmic battle, divine vulnerability, and eternal triumph. Arguably, this perspective
    reshapes our understanding of eschatology. The end of linear time suggests not static eternity but full
    participation in cyclical time&rsquo;s eternal theo-drama. The new creation represents not chaos&rsquo;s absence
    but its perpetual defeat: the dragon bound yet preserved, enabling endless divine triumph.</p>
    <p class="centered"><span class="bigger">7.</span></p>
    <p>In the spirit world, Christ&rsquo;s victory over the devil reveals how worldly sinfulness stems from
    participation in diabolic evil. The concept of symbolic participation finds its perfect analogy in magnetic
    induction:<br>
    <br>
    Consider two magnets under paper, one representing Christ and the other the devil. Iron filings, influenced by the
    magnetic field, acquire their own polarity and become induced magnets. These magnetized particles align into chains
    and clusters, revealing the invisible field&rsquo;s pattern.<br>
    <br>
    Similarly, humans become participants in either divine or diabolic nature: those united with Christ reflect His
    character, while those aligned with the devil mirror diabolic qualities. As Irenaeus notes: &ldquo;And those who do
    not believe, and do not obey His will, are sons and angels of the devil, because they do the works of the
    devil&rdquo; (&ldquo;Against Heresies&rdquo;, IV, 41:2).<br>
    <br>
    When the Christ-magnet appears, it draws filings away from the devil-magnet&rsquo;s influence, realigning them to
    truth&rsquo;s pattern. Augustine wisely termed this realignment the &ldquo;City of God&rdquo; rather than the
    &ldquo;kingdom of God,&rdquo; thus avoiding secular misinterpretation.</p>
    <p class="centered"><span class="bigger">8.</span></p>The Holy Spirit is not an abstract third person or mere
    ethereal energy, but rather the dynamic presence that makes the kingdom&rsquo;s mythical reality accessible to
    creation. Beyond simply applying Christ&rsquo;s benefits or conveying grace generally, the Spirit specifically
    enables consciousness to perceive and enter the kingdom of God.<br>
    <br>
    In this light, sanctification through the Spirit transforms from mere moral improvement into progressive initiation
    into mythical patterns. As the Spirit works, we are not simply becoming morally superior but learning to embody
    patterns of heavenly life. We are being prepared for our roles in the cosmic theo-drama.<br>
    <br>
    The challenge of discerning spirits becomes clearer: if the Holy Spirit enables authentic symbolic participation,
    other spirits offer counterfeit or distorted participations. The demonic represents not merely evil, but the power
    that corrupts symbolic patterns, offering participation in anti-myths that parody divine patterns. Discernment
    therefore involves recognizing which mythic narratives various spirits draw us toward.<br>
    <br>
    Theo-dramatic patterns remain sealed in transcendence without the Spirit; through the Spirit, they transform into
    lived reality for created beings. The Spirit enables mythic consciousness that perceives and participates in the
    celestial drama eternally unfolding in God&rsquo;s mind.<br>
    <br>
    Theosis through symbolic participation follows dramatic rather than metaphysical logic. Rather than ascending
    through ontological ranks towards divine simplicity, we progressively deepen our identification with our roles in
    God&rsquo;s mythic kingdom. As method actors dissolve the boundary between self and character through profound
    embodiment, we &ldquo;put on Christ&rdquo; until the mythic pattern constitutes our essential identity.<br>
    <br>
    This framework illuminates the relationship between individual and cosmic deification. Each person has unique
    mythical roles to embody within the cosmic drama, specific patterns in God&rsquo;s mind that only they can
    actualize. These individual roles interweave within creation&rsquo;s larger mythic narrative of deification. As
    creatures enter their mythic identities, creation increasingly manifests kingdom mythology. Theosis thus
    encompasses both personal and cosmic participation.<br>
    <br>
    This represents Christianity&rsquo;s ultimate promise: not escape from narrative into abstract being, but eternal
    participation in the inexhaustible mythical richness of God&rsquo;s consciousness.<br>
    <br>
    <span class="bigger">Stairwell to the Abyss</span><br>
    <br>
    Dreams may offer moments when human consciousness briefly intersects with the heavenly narrative. Recently, I
    experienced a dream that I interpret as angelic communication due to its paradigmatic nature:
    <p></p>
    <blockquote>
      I have wandered deep into a concrete shaft and reached a level that feels like the underworld. The way down is a
      cave passage, but down here everything is raw, gray concrete and eerily empty. The walls rise high. From the
      corner of this concrete platform, a broad metal staircase descends into compact darkness. The atmosphere is
      ominous. High above, I can still see a square glimmer of light from the entrance, like a pale memory of the world
      above. Unlike many who went before me, I know there exists a path back, while they faced no alternative but to
      descend further into the consuming darkness. A supernatural darkness wells up from the stairs below, deeper than
      any I&rsquo;ve ever experienced. The darkness has unfolded like pointed black petals that reach into the room. A
      fateful feeling grips me.
    </blockquote>
    <p>The dream evokes Plato&rsquo;s cave allegory, yet departs from it through its emphasis on descent. I felt peace
    knowing the upward &ldquo;narrow path&rdquo; that was unknown to most. The thought of generations descending into
    darkness, unaware of the saving path, haunted me. What gave them courage to descend? Analyzing the dream, I
    realized the descent appeared as the obvious route, marked by industrial stairs. The fact that they went together
    gave them courage.<br>
    <br>
    Swiatecka&rsquo;s work illuminated why I felt comfortable in this threshold space: echoing Plato&rsquo;s cave, the
    concrete wall served as a screen for mythic drama. Most striking was the darkness that entered from below, not mere
    absence but a tangible, predatory force. Though I accept Augustine&rsquo;s view of evil as privation, this dream
    revealed a realm where darkness possesses autonomous substance, challenging my monistic assumptions.<br>
    <br>
    The mythical perspective, with its embrace of archetypal patterns, transcends both Augustine&rsquo;s view of evil
    as privation and the argument that evil exists for free will. Instead, it grants evil positive reality within the
    kingdom of God, which aligns with Jung&rsquo;s concept that the psyche generates both light and shadow as essential
    structure. Although cosmic evil belongs to the heavenly drama, this evil remains genuine, as its participatory
    manifestations in the world create concrete harm.</p>
