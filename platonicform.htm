<h5>The Resolution of the Third Man Argument</h5>
<p><i>Abstract</i>: Self-predication defines the Form. Unity is constituted
(not invalidated) by the Third Man regress. Participation is envisaged as a
cognitive process. The harmful consequences of anti-Platonic philosophy in
the modern era is discussed.

<p><br>
Although Plato never arrives at a final definition of the Forms it is
evident that they must be understood as otherworldly particulars, i.e.,
perfect and eternal &lsquo;things&rsquo; that serve as models for all
earthly things. This is the theory of Forms as explicated in the
<i>Republic</i>. To the modern mind, it comes across as na√Øve, as we today
reason in terms of abstract universals and concrete particulars. But
Francis&nbsp;A.&nbsp;Grabowski&nbsp;III (2008) has established without a
doubt that this is how we must understand the theory of Forms.
Bertrand&nbsp;Russell comes to the same conclusion, although he is less
sympathetic:</p>
<blockquote>Plato makes a mistake analogous to saying &lsquo;human is
human&rsquo;. He thinks that beauty is beautiful; he thinks that the
universal &lsquo;man&rsquo; is the name of a pattern man created by God, of
whom actual men are imperfect and somewhat unreal copies. He fails
altogether to realize how great is the gap between universals and
particulars; his &lsquo;ideas&rsquo; are really just other particulars,
ethically and aesthetically superior to the ordinary kind. (2009,
p.&#8239;112)</blockquote>
<p>As I understand it, Plato does not say &lsquo;human is human&rsquo;. He
says that the human Form is human, something which could be formulated, in
terms of set theory, as a set containing itself. Russell understands the
theory of Forms to be a premature attempt to cope with the problem of
universals. He argues that much of Plato&rsquo;s thought belongs to the
&ldquo;infantile diseases of philosophy&rdquo;. However, it is important to
remember that Forms are <i>not</i> to be understood as abstract universals
dressed up in poetic language. On the contrary, the Form is the <i>real
thing</i>, belonging to an ontological realm superior to sublunar
existence. The latter is ontologically inferior and contains particulars
that are less real, because they are mere imitations of their ultimate
exemplars. Even to this day, philosophers continue to wrestle with this
arcane theory. Evidently, Russell gravely underestimates its value,
considering that people remain enamoured by it. It has a hold on the human
psyche. Plato says through Socrates:</p>
<blockquote>If anything else is beautiful besides Beauty itself, it is
beautiful for no other reason than because it participates in that Beauty,
and this applies to everything. (<i>Phaedo</i>, 100c)</blockquote>
<p>But can it be logically defended? If we grant that the Form of Beauty is
itself beautiful (<i>Symposium</i> 210e, <i>Phaedo</i> 100c), then it leads
to a regress called the Third Man argument (<i>Parmenides</i> 132a-e): the
Form must itself participate in Beauty, which must itself participate in
Beauty, etc. Both Plato and Aristotle believed that the theory of Forms was
vulnerable to the Third Man argument. I shall argue that they were wrong
and that the regress infinitism is really what constitutes the Form. The
Third Man argument does not invalidate the theory of
Forms&#8239;&mdash;&thinsp;it does just the opposite! Self-predication
belongs to the very definition of the Form and self-participation is what
generates the unity of the Form. Instead of saying that the Form of Beauty
has beauty or is beautiful, we could also say:</p>
<p class="cn1">(1) The Form of Beauty participates in Beauty</p>
<p>A Form is really a triunity. The copula conjoins subject and object, and
that&rsquo;s why it constitutes a triunity. For the very reason that the
Form of Beauty is Beautiful and the Form of White has Whiteness it is
evident that Platonic Form must be defined this way&#8239;&mdash;&thinsp;as
a oneness of three, a triunity.
<br>
<br>
What was thought to be the refutation is really the solution, i.e., to
acknowledge that the Form of Beauty is generated by participation. The
presence of the logical copula is essential. I rely on
Richard&nbsp;Gaskin&rsquo;s (2008) argument that the unity of the
proposition is, contrary to expectation, <i>constituted</i> (not
invalidated) by Bradley&rsquo;s regress (a variant of the Third Man). It
arises from the fact that relations cannot connect their relata if they are
not themselves connected to their relata. This gives rise to a never-ending
series of relations connecting relata. Gaskin argues that it is a harmless
and constituting regress, the solution to the unity problem (cf. Winther,
2021). The regress occurs due to the fact that the relation between Form
and Beauty is conceived as an independent third element. Unity is
continually inherited from the previous proposition in the series:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Form and Beauty are One by Participation
<br>
<br></li>
<li>Form, Beauty and Participation are One by Participation<sub class=
"smaller">1</sub>
<br>
<br></li>
<li>Form, Beauty, Participation and Participation<sub class=
"smaller">1</sub> are One by Participation<sub class=
"smaller">2</sub>&#8239;, and so on <i>ad infinitum</i></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Unlike what F.&#8239;H. Bradley himself thought, the regress does not
involve the interminable practical task of connecting links. Gaskin
says:</p>
<blockquote>Bradley&rsquo;s regress, like the structure of the rational or
real line, is infinitistic in a metaphysical, not a practical, sense, and
for that reason is not vicious: it imposes a specific infinitistic
condition on the structure of propositions&#8239;&mdash;&thinsp;and so
ultimately&nbsp;[&hellip;] on the structure of the world
itself&#8239;&mdash;&thinsp;and not an infinitistic, and so unperformable,
task for the understander. (Gaskin, 2008, p.&#8239;351)</blockquote>
<p>Cantorian set theory allows us to define multiplicity as a unit, and
thus the Form of Beauty may be formulated as a set. Sets are denoted by any
number of members embraced by curly brackets. We may represent
participation in Beauty as a set that contains itself as a member, where
f&nbsp;= form, p&nbsp;= participation, and b&nbsp;= beauty.</p>
<p class="cn1"><i>P</i> = {&#8239;f, {p}, b&#8239;}</p>
<p>Because the set contains itself it leads to an eternal regress. It
represents a unifying process from eternity that is always generating the
Form of Beauty. Participation is one with the Form and identical to the
unified Form itself. As proven by Georg&nbsp;Cantor, this is an
&lsquo;actual infinity&rsquo;, that is, something completed and definite
(cf. Wiki, &lsquo;Actual infinity&rsquo;). Hence an infinity can be
regarded as a unity, that is, as a unique Form. This was not known to Plato
who, along with Aristotle, thought that it simply denoted a limit that
could never be reached. The Aristotelian concept of infinity is outdated. Nearly all of today&rsquo;s mathematicians and logicians accept Cantor&rsquo;s &lsquo;actual infinity&rsquo;. Augustine explains that if something acquires unity
it acquires <i>being</i>:</p>
<blockquote>For order reduces to a certain uniformity that which it
arranges; and existence is nothing else than being one. Thus, so far as
anything acquires unity, so far it exists. (<i>De morib.</i>,
6.8)</blockquote>
<p>In perpetual self-participation the Form is forever becoming real and
its unity reconstituted. In the dialogues a Form is said to be one
(<i>hen</i> or <i>monoeides</i>) (even though some passages suggest that a
Form cannot be simple in the strict sense). This criterion is also
satisfied, in the sense that perpetual participation manifests the Form as
One. The composite generates the simple in the way that the Form of White
generates perfect whiteness. Note that we could just as well talk about the
<i>procession</i> of the Form, because it doesn&rsquo;t matter if we climb
up or down the ladder, so to speak. A Form is an instance of itself. It is
more of a self-generative dynamism than a static thing.
<br><br>
The Third Man argument does not mean that there are eternally many Forms F. Rather, it means that F participates with itself by recursion, <i>ad infinitum</i>. The regress is internal to the Form, occurs outside time, and is what manifests the Form. This means that we can regard the Platonic Form as an eternally self-participating unity. Central to the argument is that the regress infinitism is not an infinite task, practically unperformable. Rather, it has a holistic explanatory status, like the mythological image of an infinite series of turtles that upholds the earth. What illustrates this is that the Ramanujan series 1&nbsp;+ 2&nbsp;+ 3&nbsp;+ 4&nbsp;+ 5&nbsp;+&nbsp;&hellip; sums up to -1/12. Intuitively, this doesn&rsquo;t make sense. But it&rsquo;s a fact, and Mother Nature makes use of this number. This infinite series has a &ldquo;holistic explanatory status&rdquo; equal to -1/12 (cf. Wiki: &lsquo;1&nbsp;+ 2&nbsp;+ 3&nbsp;+ 4&nbsp;+&nbsp;&hellip;&rsquo;).
<br><br>
It seems to me that there are analogous developments in the philosophy of meaning and truth. According to The Revision Theory of Truth, the concept of truth is circular (cf. Kremer&nbsp;&amp; Rivello, 2023). This circularity gives rise to a process of revision that determines the truth status, a process that involves a continuous reference to truth. The revision hierarchy may or may not terminate&#8239;&mdash;&thinsp;it is possibly eternal. Nonetheless, it is a unity of truth. This could also be said of the Platonic Form. (However, I&rsquo;m not certain that this is relevant to my discussion, because this is above my head.)
<br>
<br>
Does the concept that infinitistic regress creates unity make sense? Arguably, this is Platonic logics pertaining to the
otherworldly realm, and we needn&rsquo;t worry so much about its scientific
applicability. Plato&rsquo;s dictum &lsquo;one over many&rsquo; is
important to religion, especially Christian religion:</p>
<blockquote>For just as through the disobedience of the one man the many
were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one man the many
will be made righteous. (Romans 5:19)</blockquote>
<p>This is Platonic in the sense that the universal exemplar encompasses
individual plurality. Inasmuch as Adam is the representative of mankind,
all his descendants are thought to be personally involved in his sin. In a
corresponding way we partake of Christ&rsquo;s work of atonement. We fell
in Adam but are exalted again in Christ: &ldquo;For as in Adam all die, so
in Christ all will be made alive&rdquo; (1&#8239;Cor. 15:22). Religion
makes use of Platonic Ideas and would lose its validity without them. It
can&rsquo;t be helped that it seems contrary to
science&#8239;&mdash;&thinsp;without the doctrine of original sin we could
not understand ourselves. Blaise&nbsp;Pascal (1623-1662) says:</p>
<blockquote>Original sin is folly in the eyes of men, but it is given as
such. You must not, therefore, reproach me for the lack of reason in this
doctrine, since I give it as being without reason. But this folly is wiser
than all the wisdom of men, is wiser than men. For without it, what will we
say man is? His whole state depends on this imperceptible point. And how
could he perceive it through his reason, since it is something contrary to
his reason, and his reason, far from discovering it by its own ways, draws
away when presented with it? (Pascal, <i>Pens√©es</i>)</blockquote>
<p>Platonic and religious statements are not statements about the world as
disjunct from man. They are human statements about the world and man in
interrelation. For this we have recourse to symbols, archetypes and Forms,
as well as the principle of &lsquo;one over many&rsquo;. Rationalists such
as Russell may be right that it is folly, but in that case folly is
indispensable in human life. That&rsquo;s why Paul says:</p>
<blockquote>For since, in God&rsquo;s wisdom, the world did not know God
through wisdom, God was pleased to save those who believe through the
foolishness of the message preached. (1&#8239;Cor. 1:21)</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;We are fools for Christ&rsquo;s sake&rdquo;, he says. As Prof.
Wilfred&nbsp;Cantwell&nbsp;Smith (scholar of religious studies, 1916-2000)
explains, modern rationalists hold the view that a system of thought must
satisfactorily explain reality. This seems adequate, aside from the fact
that by &ldquo;reality&rdquo; they mean the non-human world only. It is
unduly limited in that we have not only to interpret reality but also to
live with it and with each other (cf. Smith, 1977, p.&#8239;28). Smith
says:</p>
<blockquote>Any system of thought, ostensibly &ldquo;scientific&rdquo; or
whatever, that finds Christian (or Islamic, or Buddhist) discourse either
meaningless or simply false, is announcing that it can understand and
interpret the world of physical nature but not the world of man. (Smith,
1977, p.&#8239;33)</blockquote>
<p>We know today that transcendental concepts are necessary to come to
grips with human reality. But we do not know why it is so. We aren&rsquo;t
sure why Platonic thinking is effective; nor can we be certain that the
Forms really exist &ldquo;out there&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s <i>as if</i> they
abide forever in the <i>hyperuranion</i> or in God&rsquo;s mind, and we
only know them when they take shape in the soul. However, we can be certain
that transcendental Forms affect the human condition and that human beings
in turn have a great impact in the world.
<br>
<br>
Smith explains that people in history have never defined religious faith in
terms of its object. Faith was always regarded a quality of the person, but
never as an externalized viewing. The meaning of faith is to pledge heart
and soul to the divine. In the modern understanding, however, religious
&ldquo;belief&rdquo; is directed towards an object. As a consequence,
religious life has taken a wrong turn: &ldquo;a great modern heresy of the
Church is the heresy of believing&rdquo; (p.&#8239;v). Instead we ought to
commit ourselves to transcendental Truth and live in loyalty with God.
<br>
<br>
Faith means to have God in one&rsquo;s heart; it does not mean to
&ldquo;believe&rdquo; that God invisibly exists &ldquo;out there&rdquo;. In
his important work, <i>Modernity and Plato: two paradigms of
rationality</i> (2012), Arbogast&nbsp;Schmitt explains what caused this
change of view. It stems primarily from the rejection of the epistemology
of Plato and Aristotle, which took its beginning in the late 14th century
with the writings of Duns&nbsp;Scotus and William&nbsp;of&nbsp;Occam.
Earlier it was thought that the senses receive the perceptible forms sans
the matter, as explicated in Aristotle&rsquo;s <i>De&nbsp;Anima</i>
(ii-iii). The thing perceived is received in the soul, like an imprint in
wax, and it is the intellect which brings about this unity. Minds, in a
non-literal way, become isomorphic with their objects (cf. Shields, 2020).
Thus, we must always perform an intellectual work of discrimination and
understanding. For example, a pair of scissors is only truly perceived when
one understands its function. A cognitive process, together with values of
feeling, has to rely on abstract concepts to model a corresponding form in
the soul. According to Plato and Aristotle, perception requires an
intellectual act of discrimination between what is essential and what is
not; experience must originate from the memory records of repeated
perceptions.
<br>
<br>
In modernity, however, unity is found immediately in
&ldquo;intuition&rdquo;, insomuch as the individual object is a given,
already intellectually determined in itself. According to Duns&nbsp;Scotus,
the senses can forthwith receive the multiplicity of sense impressions as a
uniform whole (<i>simul totum</i>). Consequently, the intellect is
construed as secondary whereas the outside object, as such, is endowed with
a primary and foundational role for perception. Such a &ldquo;philosophy of
representation&rdquo; is characterized by a &ldquo;metaphysical overload of
the individual object&rdquo; (p.&#8239;28). It is really an
&ldquo;epistemologically na√Øve copy-realism that lies in the conviction
that in thinking one can begin with individual objects and derive
one&rsquo;s concepts &lsquo;from experience.&rsquo;&#8239;&rdquo;
(p.&#8239;36). Says Schmitt:</p>
<blockquote>The central impulse in this turn [of thinking] onto itself is
the acceptance of empirical reality and one&rsquo;s own existence in the
here and now as the sole yardstick of insight and action: only that which
is presently there and can be sensually experienced and verifiably exists
is recognized as being real and as something thought can draw on in forming
its concepts. This conviction was originally and is even today
anti-Platonic in intent: it rejects the Platonic doctrine of a reality to
ideas, that is, of a &ldquo;thing itself&rdquo; that is recognizable in a
purely rational way, and, instead, insists on the immediate evidence of
sensually experienceable individual objects. Historically, this
development, through which this anti-Platonism became accepted as the
virtually unanimous conviction, had several phases. However, even after
these speculative theories were allegedly overcome, Plato remained and
remains <i>the</i> antipode in relation to whom the individual
&ldquo;critical turn&rdquo; is executed each time.
(p.&#8239;xxiii)</blockquote>
<p>Only a Form can manifest as an instance of itself, in the manner of a
transcendent individual. To the extent that a particular participates in
the one Individual, it receives a measure of the divine. But in the modern
era, the individual has become sufficient unto himself. The intellect has
turned onto itself. The ruinous consequences of anti-Platonism and
nominalism have become evident in the growing egotism among people. An
individual is understood as an instance of himself. Accordingly, any person
is everybody&rsquo;s equal, even if he has a criminal background. One is no
longer expected to participate in the Form of the Individual. On the
contrary, being curved into oneself fulfills the value of the individual
(<i>incurvatus in se</i>; Luther). Schmitt says:</p>
<blockquote>The early modern period was well aware of the theological
implications of making the individual absolute. Declaring the individual to
be an instance of itself means nothing other than declaring the world to be
the direct and immediate embodiment of God, that is, of an absolute
rationality (&ldquo;God does not play at dice&rdquo;). When one recalls
that Hegel&rsquo;s projection of the Christian doctrine of trinity onto the
history of the development of the world itself emerged from this concept
and that the idea of the embodiment of the absolute spirit in the
individual peoples and thus the modern religious idealization of the
nation-state in turn emerged from his projection, one has an eminent
example of the tremendous significance of this metaphysical turn to
experience. (pp.&#8239;29-30)</blockquote>
<p>We can now better understand Paul&rsquo;s model of faith as
participation in Christ and why Augustine saw the Eucharistic meal as the
eating of the &ldquo;inner bread&rdquo;. Inner representation depends on a
Platonic-Aristotelian epistemology of participation, through which a
corresponding form is moulded in the soul. To have faith means that Christ
takes form in the soul (&ldquo;[I]t is no longer I who live, but Christ
lives in me&rdquo;; Gal. 2:20). The horrors of the modern era have their
explanation in the decline of the Christian-Platonic worldview and
epistemology. The modern bias, that truth exists nowhere but outside us and
is ready to be appropriated, continues to undermine society and overall
mental health. It is not the question of submitting to the belief that
Forms exist external to us. Rather, we are supposed to <i>participate</i>
in the Forms in order for them to incarnate. The rationalist views it as
folly; but according to Paul, the participation in the Logos is the only
way of redemption. In this article I have augmented the Platonic principle
of participation by proposing that it is part and parcel of the Form.</p>
