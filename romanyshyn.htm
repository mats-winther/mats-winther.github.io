    <h2>Critique of idealistic phenomenologism</h2>
    <p><br>
    <br>
    Post-Jungian psychologists James&nbsp;Hillman, Wolfgang&nbsp;Giegerich, and Robert&nbsp;Romanyshyn have embraced
    idealistic phenomenology in their work. This analysis focuses on Romanyshyn&rsquo;s phenomenological worldview as
    expressed in an interview about his book &ldquo;Technology as Symptom and Dream.&rdquo; While Romanyshyn argues
    that modern science and technology have created a psychological rift in the human psyche, both his diagnosis of the
    underlying problem and his proposed path to healing are flawed.<br>
    <br>
    Romanyshyn&rsquo;s call to restore the concept of &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; or &ldquo;mind&rdquo; within matter reflects
    a fundamental misunderstanding. He mistakes matter for the unconscious, effectively projecting the collective
    unconscious onto the material world. Jung identified this tendency as characteristic of medieval alchemy,
    suggesting that Romanyshyn&rsquo;s approach represents a regression to an archaic mindset. His portrayal of modern
    humanity&rsquo;s alienation from material nature misses the mark as a diagnosis of our contemporary condition.<br>
    <br>
    Contemporary humanity remains deeply entrenched in materialism and material values&#8239;&mdash;&thinsp;a
    consequence of the decline in spiritual consciousness, or what might be termed &ldquo;the demise of the
    gods.&rdquo; The core problem isn&rsquo;t our disconnection from external nature, but rather our estrangement from
    the collective unconscious. Despite Jung&rsquo;s extensive writings on the collective unconscious, this crucial
    insight seems to have gone largely unrecognized.<br>
    <br>
    The path to healing modern humanity&rsquo;s psychological divide lies in bringing archetypal awareness into public
    consciousness. As we&rsquo;ve lost our connection to the world of gods and spirits, we must now understand the
    psychological realities that underlay these ancient concepts&#8239;&mdash;&thinsp;the archetypes themselves. During
    medieval times, when unconscious factors were still conceived as metaphysical entities, people maintained a
    connection to the collective unconscious and weren&rsquo;t as thoroughly dominated by materialism as they are
    today.<br>
    <br>
    While the rise of science and technology coincided with the decline of divine concepts, leading to a disruption in
    our relationship with the collective unconscious, Jung has offered a solution through his theory of
    archetypes&#8239;&mdash;&thinsp;a vital truth that shouldn&rsquo;t be withheld from public understanding.
    Attempting to revive pagan concepts of an ensouled matter is futile; such outdated conceptual frameworks cannot
    adequately address contemporary psychological challenges.<br>
    <br>
    Romanyshyn misrepresents both Jung and the scientific community when he attributes to them a Cartesian dualist
    position&#8239;&mdash;&thinsp;the view that mind is a distinct entity existing independently alongside the body,
    mysteriously directing brain and bodily functions. This characterization is outdated; contemporary scientific
    thought has largely moved beyond such strict dualism.<br>
    <br>
    While alternatives to physicalism exist, physicalism serves as a useful framework for this discussion due to its
    current relevance. Within this metaphysical framework, one can still defend the concept of a substantially
    autonomous psyche by understanding the mental realm as a holistic system categorically distinct from the physical
    body. The psyche operates at a different natural level than the body, rather than existing as an independent
    soul&#8239;&mdash;&thinsp;a misconception arising from confusion between these levels of analysis. Jung says:</p>
    <blockquote>
      The life of the body or of a man is posited as something different from the man himself. This led to the &lsquo;ka&rsquo; or
      immortal soul, able to detach itself from the body and not dependent on it for its existence&nbsp;[&hellip;] The
      juxtaposition of a person and his &ldquo;life&rdquo; has its psychological basis in the fact that a mind which is not very
      well differentiated cannot think abstractly and is incapable of putting things into categories. It can only take
      the qualities it perceives and place them side by side: man and his life, or his sickness (visualized as a sort
      of demon), or his health or prestige (mana, etc.). This is obviously the case with the Egyptian &lsquo;ka&rsquo;. (C.&#8239;G. Jung,
      Psychology and Religion, CW&nbsp;11, para.&thinsp;198).
    </blockquote>
    <p>Since the early 1970s, holistic theory has evolved significantly, lending support to Jung&rsquo;s concept of the
    psyche&rsquo;s objective reality as an independent system of processes. While Jung himself may have favored a
    different monistic framework, his metaphysical views are compatible with holistic understanding.<br>
    <br>
    In holistic theory, the psyche is understood as an emergent system&#8239;&mdash;&thinsp;a coherent structure
    manifesting at a collective level, distinct from and irreducible to its component parts, such as individual
    neurons. Nobel laureate Ilya Prigogine&rsquo;s extensive research on self-organizing systems has advanced our
    mathematical understanding of such emergent phenomena. Though his work focuses on simpler systems, it provides a
    theoretical foundation for understanding more complex emergent properties like consciousness.<br>
    <br>
    Nobel laureate Roger W. Sperry conceptualizes mental phenomena as holistic configurational properties that both
    transcend and differ from their constituent neural events. According to Sperry, these higher-order entities operate
    according to their own principles and laws, which cannot be reduced to lower-level neurological processes. His
    framework, detailed in &ldquo;Consciousness and the Brain&rdquo; (1976), aligns remarkably well with Jung&rsquo;s
    understanding of psychic autonomy.<br>
    <br>
    The concept of &lsquo;downward causation&rsquo; has enhanced our understanding of mind-brain interaction,
    explaining how mental processes can influence neurological activity. This principle is illustrated by social insect
    colonies, where individual termites perform simple operations without comprehending the overall design, yet
    collectively create sophisticated structures with complex features like helical air-conditioning and water drainage
    systems. These emergent properties exist at the colony level, making the colony itself a kind of organism with
    advanced capabilities.<br>
    <br>
    Similarly, the brain can be understood as a colony of neurons providing the hardware infrastructure for the
    psyche&rsquo;s holistic software level, where archetypal entities reside and operate. This modern hardware-software
    analogy offers a compelling framework for understanding Jung&rsquo;s archetypal theory, challenging those
    post-Jungians who dismiss it as implausible. While this interpretation remains grounded in
    physicalism&#8239;&mdash;&thinsp;which may be seen as a limitation&#8239;&mdash;&thinsp;it demonstrates the
    theoretical viability of Jung&rsquo;s archetypal concept within contemporary scientific understanding.<br>
    <br>
    The persistence of level-confusion among modern theorists is perplexing. It&rsquo;s misguided to locate the soul in
    external nature, as Romanyshyn does, or in the pineal gland, as Descartes proposed. The concept of
    &lsquo;soul&rsquo; may not require physical location at all. Romanyshyn&rsquo;s claim that &ldquo;the
    interiorization of the soul still haunts Jung&rsquo;s psychology&rdquo; reveals his own confusion, treating soul as
    a physical entity existing on the same conceptual plane as the body.<br>
    <br>
    From a holistic perspective, the soul and mental realm can be understood as an objectively existing holistic level
    of reality that transcends physical properties like location, weight, or extension. This concept is analogous to
    &lsquo;nationality&rsquo;&#8239;&mdash;&thinsp;an objectively real phenomenon that exists at a distinct conceptual
    level without physical location.<br>
    <br>
    Romanyshyn misinterprets humanity&rsquo;s apparent separation from nature, which actually results from the
    development of ego consciousness and the withdrawal of psychological projections. The solution to modern alienation
    isn&rsquo;t to revert to attributing soul-substance to nature. The evolution of consciousness represents a crucial
    advancement that cannot and should not be reversed. Our relationship with our environment should be based on
    objective understanding rather than psychological projection.<br>
    <br>
    As a phenomenologist, Romanyshyn rejects Cartesian dualism, but his solution&#8239;&mdash;&thinsp;eliminating mind
    and reducing it to &ldquo;flesh,&rdquo; like materialist reductionists&#8239;&mdash;&thinsp;ignores significant
    developments in holistic science that recognize the psyche as an objectively existing holistic dimension. He
    attempts to compensate for this reduction by reimagining the material world as inherently mindful, suggesting that
    mind resides within natural objects. This view, which claims that recognizing matter as animate would solve
    psychological issues (such as anorexia), reflects a simplistic understanding.<br>
    <br>
    Romanyshyn overlooks crucial advances in holistic theory, which now complements rather than opposes
    reductionism&#8239;&mdash;&thinsp;both approaches being necessary for comprehensive understanding of reality. The
    multi-level framework describing mind-body relationships has superseded both Cartesian dualism and deterministic
    materialism. Thus, his crusade against Cartesian dualism is unnecessary, while his proposed solution represents a
    regression to primitive animism or pantheism. Such regression would undermine valuable insights from holism, chaos
    theory, and emergence theory.<br>
    <br>
    Romanyshyn misinterprets alchemical philosophy. The alchemical process doesn&rsquo;t aim to reanimate matter or
    locate mind within nature; rather, it emphasizes the thorough extraction of spirit from
    matter&#8239;&mdash;&thinsp;a categorical separation. Only after this separation does the process proceed to
    reunite spirit and matter through circular distillation (&lsquo;solve et coagula&rsquo;).<br>
    <br>
    Far from advocating a return to primitive animism, alchemy seeks to liberate the personality from unconscious
    dependencies, ultimately achieving a more sophisticated relationship with nature. In contemporary psychological
    terms, this represents the ego&rsquo;s liberation from unconscious identifications through expanding consciousness.
    The freed ego no longer maintains a naive bond with nature and unconscious archetypes, but instead aligns itself
    with wholeness&#8239;&mdash;&thinsp;the self.<br>
    <br>
    This elevated form of adaptation, symbolized by the philosopher&rsquo;s stone, represents a profound transformation
    comparable to Buddha&rsquo;s enlightenment. The process manifests not as a regression to animistic thinking, but as
    advancement toward higher consciousness.<br>
    <br>
    Romanyshyn&rsquo;s proposed treatment for anorexia&#8239;&mdash;&thinsp;recognizing matter as
    animate&#8239;&mdash;&thinsp;misses the mark. The anorexic&rsquo;s excessive self-loathing typically manifests as
    an obsessive fixation on body and food, deemed inherently inferior. This overemphasis on the physical realm
    reflects our era&rsquo;s lack of genuine spirituality, largely resulting from Christianity&rsquo;s decline and
    deterioration. The feminine spiritual principle, in particular, has become trapped in material
    manifestations&#8239;&mdash;&thinsp;money, physical beauty, and bodily concerns.<br>
    <br>
    The solution lies opposite to Romanyshyn&rsquo;s suggestion: cultivating awareness of spirit independent of
    matter&#8239;&mdash;&thinsp;the traditional spiritual or transcendental approach. A spiritual counselor might help
    an anorexic recognize non-physical values and an transcendent reality where higher truth and beauty reside. When
    materialistic individuals embrace spiritual and invisible values, their fixation on physical matter and body
    typically diminishes. However, contemporary scientific materialism has complicated this spiritual interpretation,
    hampering the effectiveness of traditional spiritual therapeutic approaches.<br>
    <br>
    Jungian psychotherapy offers a solution by equating consciousness development with &ldquo;liberating spirit from
    matter.&rdquo; A patient&rsquo;s physical fixations typically diminish when they become aware of the underlying
    psychological complex&#8239;&mdash;&thinsp;a fundamental approach to treating neurosis. Jung rejected suggestive
    treatment methods like those advocated by Romanyshyn and New Age practitioners. Instead, he promoted expanding
    conscious awareness to embrace a new form of spirituality centered on ego emancipation.<br>
    <br>
    Analytical psychology&rsquo;s effective methodology can awaken spiritual passion. Sometimes, exposure to accessible
    works like &ldquo;Modern Man in Search of a Soul&rdquo; is sufficient to transform one&rsquo;s worldview. An
    anorexic patient could benefit from engaging with such perspectives, as they reveal the spiritual crisis underlying
    neurotic conditions. This process &ldquo;frees spirit from matter&rdquo;&#8239;&mdash;&thinsp;replacing bodily
    fixation with conscious judgment and decision-making, fostering a mindset equipped to address psychological
    challenges.<br>
    <br>
    Romanyshyn&rsquo;s attempted synthesis of phenomenology and analytical psychology proves untenable. By eliminating
    the concept of the &lsquo;objective psyche&rsquo;&#8239;&mdash;&thinsp;the cornerstone of analytical
    psychology&#8239;&mdash;&thinsp;he undermines his own argument. His advocacy for a metaphorical consciousness that
    views reality as an endless succession of dreams and myths contradicts his simultaneous call for responsibility.
    True responsibility requires confronting objective reality rather than reframing it through perpetual metaphor.
    Romanyshyn&rsquo;s proposed solution to modern alienation offers only temporary relief through suggestion rather
    than genuine psychological transformation.</p>
