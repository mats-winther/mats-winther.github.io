<TD><FONT FACE="Courier New"><I>Abstract: </I>  in the evolution of game
diagrams and rules boardgames have come to mirror not only cultural aspects but
also the transformations in the collective psyche. In the historical perspective
the boardgame is a collective effort, and therefore it portrays the collective
psyche in the form of mandala shapes pertaining to the whole numbers, such as
three and four. The symbolic values of the different geometries and numbers are
recurrent themes in cultural history, and denote different stages in the
progression of consciousness. In particular, the boardgame is understood as an
equivalent of the vessel in medieval alchemy.<BR><BR><I>Keywords:</I>

Ancient and medieval people viewed boardgames as doorways to the spiritual
sphere. They notoriously carved them into temple walls and roofs.  In the
ancient temple at Kurna in Egypt (c. 1400 BCE) there are more than seventy board
games painstakingly carved into the roofing slabs. In Gloucester Cathedral
several
<I>Fox and Geese</I> boards <NOBR>(fig.18)</NOBR> are incised on the stone
seats. This cross-shaped diagram also occurs inside and on the outside walls of
the cloisters of <NOBR>San Paolo,</NOBR> Rome. Boardgame patterns were put in
such places where they couldn't even be seen, walled up inside sacred places
(vid. Murray).  In ancient India game diagrams were depicted in murals, and
built into roofing slabs and the floor of temples.  In the game the devotee and
the deity met, and boards and gaming pieces were used as a means of consulting
God (vid. Vasantha).<BR CLEAR="left"><BR><FONT SIZE="-1">&nbsp; 2. Morris,

forms of <I>Morris</I> (Merels) patterns are common among the chisellings on
historical buildings and rocks at many places in the world. Several types appear
in the temple at Kurna. In Morris the goal is to get three men in a row. By
1997, researchers had documented over one thousand morris boards in an
historical and archaeological context. They also occur on vertical surfaces, as
on a roman marble slab being part of the throne of Charlemagne, <NOBR>Aix-la-Chapelle</NOBR>

<I>Fanorona</I> played an interesting part in the rituals in Madagascan
culture. At the storming of the capital by the French in 1895, the Queen and
people relied far more on the outcome of the official game which was being
played by the ritual professionals for victory, than they did on their armed
forces (cf. Murray, <NOBR>p.88).</NOBR> While it consists of two conjoined
<NOBR><I>Alquerque</I><B>[<A HREF="#alquerque">1</A>]</B></NOBR> boards, the
<I>Fanorona</I> board has unequal sides, and therefore the conflictive number
two is present. In symbolic terms the number two promotes conflict as a tendency
to disengage from unitarian unconsciousness (cf. <NOBR>v Franz,</NOBR> 1974,
<NOBR>p.91ff).</NOBR> This game employed
<I>withdrawal capture,</I> a unique move where an enemy man is taken by
withdrawing from it. To this day, playing cards are similarly used for
divination as well as for a great multitude of games.<BR CLEAR="left"><BR><FONT

The curves drawn out from the square grid, in the Indonesian game <I>Surakarta,</I>

call up spirits. <I>Surakarta</I> has a board and a mode of play which relates
it to protective designs which are found throughout Asia and as far away as
northern Europe. The <I>Surakarta</I> plan also relates to a variant of
labyrinth design found in France and England, like in Saffron Walden, Essex.

represented the land, the center is regarded as sacred and called Tara, the seat
of High Kings. As the mystical fifth dimension it represented the Otherworld

symbolized the unity of the Trinity (cf. Murray, <NOBR>p.61).</NOBR> 
<BR CLEAR="left"><BR>
<BR><B>Evolution of boardgames</B><BR><BR>Game historians have described how
developments in consciousness and culture are mirrored in the evolution of
boardgames. When a boardgame migrates to a new culture the game rules are
altered correspondingly. In Persia the Shah was worshipped almost as a God. In
this country also emerged the rule of the <I>absolute piece,</I> which cannot
be lost without losing the game. The Chinese emperor spent his whole life within
the confines of the palace walls, and so the ruler of the chessboard came to be
confined within its palace of 3x3 squares. <BR CLEAR="left"><BR><FONT

SRC="./gifs/byzanschess1.gif" ALIGN="LEFT" VSPACE="10" HSPACE="15"><BR>Chess
in medieval Byzantium took on the round shape, probably having to do with a
worldview that is theocratic, and directed at wholeness and holiness.<BR
CLEAR="left"><BR>From the prototype of <I>Chaturanga,</I> Europeans have
increased the powers of the pieces, whereas the Chinese and East Asians have
decreased the powers of several pieces. When the game migrated from the Arabic
world to Europe it encountered a world where woman not seldom held the highest
office, either as a reigning queen, <I>consors regni</I> (co-ruler) or as
temporary ruler in her capacity of mother to the juvenile king. Interestingly,
during a period in the 980s, Western Europe had a majority of female rulers (cf.
Yalom 2004, <NOBR>p.26).</NOBR> The relatively high status of women in Europe
had its ground in the pagan era. Accordingly, in medieval times the <NOBR>Virgin
Mary</NOBR> came to play more than a little role in the church's teachings. For
obvious reasons, then, this was the place and time when the powerful Queen first
appeared on the chessboard, when the weak Fers (General) was ousted from its
elevated position beside the king  (vid. Yalom 2004).<BR CLEAR="left"><BR><BR><B>Mirrors

SRC="./gifs/gala3.jpg" ALIGN="LEFT" VSPACE="10" HSPACE="15"><BR>Boardgames
employ diverse mandala structures, such as quadratic, circular, cross-shaped,
and triangular. It would correspond to the different shapes of mandala paintings
in religious practice (and also the work of patients in therapy). The quaternity
(square) is the most common. In <I>Gala,</I> from medieval Europe, the four
central squares are regarded as holy, and special rules apply to them (vid.
Glonnegger, Pennick). When pieces enter the central cross, the movement
capability is altered into a mirror-image of the outside movement. Medieval man
would undoubtedly have associated the different areas with regions of the sacred
and the profane. The quaternity is also reflected in the four absolute pieces,
the <I>Galas,</I> initially positioned in the corners. If this game is compared
with <I>Tablut</I>
<NOBR>(fig.7),</NOBR> a further differentiation has occurred in that there are
now four different piece types and the rules are more complex. This change would
probably mirror a more diversified consciousness.<BR CLEAR="left"><BR>

games</I> from Asia represent hunt games, similar to <I>Fox and Geese,</I> but
adapted to triangular boards (vid. Parker, Murray). As is typical of hunt games
the &quot;holy piece&quot; (&quot;Tiger&quot;) cannot be captured. In the more
advanced variants there are three such pieces. The object of the white player is
to enclose the red stones so they cannot move. The triangular boards emphasize
the number three. Arguably, the threesome of absolute pieces would be the
symbolical equivalent of the <I>primarius vir,</I> the unity of the Trinity, in
<I>Alea Evangelii</I> <NOBR>(fig.8).</NOBR>
<BR><BR>This game represents a <I>trinitarian</I> counterpart of the
quaternarian Gala
<NOBR>(fig.10).</NOBR> The number three, as employed in medieval alchemy and in
analytical psychology, promotes the emancipation and expansion of consciousness.
It is a masculine number that refers to the fatherly principle, i.e. scientific
understanding, societal mores and orderliness. The number four, on the other
hand, would represent the integration of the advancing consciousness with the
unconscious and instinctual roots of man, i.e. the <I>quaternity</I> as a
directionality of <NOBR>wholeness<B>[<A HREF="#quaternity">5</A>]</B>.</NOBR>
On general terms it is the concretization of the spirit as it is cast in the
subjective mould. (For more on the significance of numbers, the trinitarian and
the quaternarian, refer to
<NOBR>v Franz</NOBR> (1974), Lindorff (2004), Jung (1980), and elsewhere.)<BR><BR>According
to the psychological principle of <NOBR><I>compensation</I><B>[<A
HREF="#compensation">6</A>]</B>,</NOBR> emphasis on the number three would
point at the requirement of conscious emancipation, whereas a quaternarian
boardgame such as
<I>Gala</I> probably characterizes a psychology already steeped in the fatherly
trinitarian principle, yet with an inner tendency to advance beyond it to the
unifying quaternity.<BR CLEAR="left"><BR><FONT SIZE="-1">&nbsp; 12. Pulijudam</FONT><BR><IMG

This would point at a tendency to migrate from the threesome to the foursome,
typical of a higher consciousness that has grown stale, but now preparing to be
reintegrated in life. This theme is notorious in dreams and myths. In medieval
alchemy it is represented by the
<I>Axiom of</I> <NOBR><I>Maria</I><B>[<A HREF="#axiom">8</A>]</B></NOBR>

alternative name of <I>The Devil among the tailors</I> (cf. Glonnegger, p.151).
These games vary in design and size, but it's almost uniformly the three against
the one. See also the small variant from Latvia, ca. 1300 (fig.29). The yellow
stones, which can only descend, must try to surround the red stone, while the
latter must try to reach the apex. There are no captures. This type of game is
almost ritual in character, while it aims at enclosing the elusive and
ambivalent fourth principle.<BR CLEAR="left"><BR><FONT SIZE="-1">&nbsp;15.
Haretavl</FONT><BR><IMG
SRC="./gifs/harefyn.gif" ALIGN="LEFT" VSPACE="10" HSPACE="15"> <BR>This is a

thought to be merels game boards. But this design, it seems, can only sustain a
simplistic form of bear game. To me, it invokes the idea of a &quot;game of
transcendency&quot;, or a mandala proper. Whether humans can play on it  is no
matter. The spirits can, using spiritual rules.<BR CLEAR="left"><BR>
<BR><B>The alchemical vessel</B><BR><BR>The focal point in alchemy was the

different names for the alchemist's flask where the warring elements were
subjected to heat and underwent <I>circular distillation</I> (cmp. <I>circumambulation</I>).
The boardgame, as such, is the equivalent of the hermetic vessel, while in it
the warring elements are added and sealed off from the outside world. In
alchemical manuscripts this is depicted as the conjunction of Sol et Luna, Rex
and Regina, winged and wingless dragon, etc. (vid. Jung 1980).<BR><BR>  The
goal of the process was the appearance of a spiritual substance, i.e., the
alchemist's gold, or the red elixir, etc. From the chaos, the prima materia, of
crude material substances, will arise  the spiritual Stone of the Philosophers,
which had wonder-working properties. Jung says: </FONT></P>

a sort of vessel or flask; but one soon learns that this is an inadequate

Sixteen rebels</FONT><BR><IMG
SRC="./gifs/16reb.gif" ALIGN="LEFT" VSPACE="10" HSPACE="15"><BR>The game of 
<I>Sixteen rebels</I> reflects upon the alchemical quintessential element
represented by the holy stone in the center (cf. Winther, 2005). While it
employs <I>interception capture,</I> (see below) this game is believed to be
quite old. The board looks like a flask, where the elusive <I>spiritus
mercurialis,</I> a most holy spirit, is held captive. In keeping with the
Chinese preference for the number five, the four-cornered
<I>Alquerque</I> board was complemented with an extra structure to introduce
the number five. When a triangle emerges out of a square, it seems to signify
spirit over matter, possibly compensating an earthbound attitude. Comparatively,
in the pyramidal shape four triangles reach upwards out of the square to a joint
apex. While numbers are translatable to simple geometric structures, it seems
possible thus to analyse geometric structures and to denote the psychological
movement as the &quot;triangulation of the square&quot;, etc.<BR><BR>As in all
hunt games the red stone, which cannot be captured, must be surrounded by the
light stones. A notorious problem in alchemy was the evaporative nature of the
Spirit Mercurius. He is the prototype of the fairytale's spirit in the bottle,
who would take any chance to escape from his prison. In <I>Sixteen rebels,</I>
the red stone can achieve this by reaching the apex of the upper triangle, when
he is victorious (this is the same situation as in the <I>Hare game,</I>
fig.14). The forces of consciousness, represented by the light stones, will
encroach upon him, but several stones must be sacrificed on the way. This
coincides with a well-known psychological fact, namely that attempts at
assimilating the unconscious self are usually accompanied by a deterioration in
the primary function of consciousness. To understand it as the conflict between
conscious and unconscious is only partially correct, I think. It can also be
said to express the archetypal forces underlying the phenomena of the psyche, as
a demonic force in conflict with a celestial spirit. <BR CLEAR="left"><BR>Players
in their gaming activity follow the alchemical procedure when they become
absorbed by the transformations in their vessels, i.e. boardgames. From a
psychological vantage point, this is similar to the alchemist's labourings with
his chemicals (although chemistry, perhaps, would better appeal to fantasy). The
player is seemingly trying to synthesize the most holy substance from his game.
Involved in this work is a phantasy of  the  <I>perfect game,</I> like the
creations of the 19th century chessmaster
<NOBR>Adolf Anderssen,</NOBR> whose games have been named accordingly, e.g., &quot;The
Immortal Game&quot;, and &quot;The Evergreen Game&quot;.<BR><BR>It is close to
an alchemical notion. Unconsciously, the players search to create the game that
will have wholesome effects on the ones who play it, bestow on them long lives,
and perhaps also have benevolent effects on the surrounding world.<BR><BR><BR>

Possibly it was played by the Old Kingdom pharaos. The archaic interception
capture bears witness to its antiquity. In order to make a capture one must
surround an enemy piece with two of one's own. The capture method of the short

<I>Siga</I> the men (&quot;dogs&quot;) are not positioned in a battle line.
Before play begins pieces are dropped one by one on the board. This relates the
image of an  intermixed conscious and unconscious, i.e. a less organized psychic
structure. In ancient times projections of the unconscious was to a much higher
degree intermixed with reality. The spirits of the unconscious existed

and Geese</I> (originally named <I>Fox and Hounds</I>) was played obsessively
by the medievals. In it we see a more orderly setup. The game originated with
thirteen men (Geese), which are trying to surround the lonely Fox, initially
positioned in the centre of the cross-shaped board. The red Fox can be
understood either as the elusive Mercurius or the Christ  (the <NOBR><I>Self</I><B>[<A

the celestial forces, or more prosaically, the combined forces of consciousness,
attempting to enclose the precious divinity. Again, the interpretation of the
central piece as the divine entity finds it counterpart in Alea Evangelii
(fig.7). Also here the goal is to surround the 'primarius vir' as the manifest
symbol of the godhead. <BR><BR><I>Fox and Geese</I> underwent an interesting
development. Historically the number of Geese increased, first to fifteen, and
then to seventeen. But this also implied that their movement was restricted,
while the Fox retained its free movement. With fifteen Geese backward movement
is prohibited, and with seventeen Geese also diagonal movement is prohibited.<BR

the setup is typically represented (e.g. in Bell, vol.II, p.46, and Glonnegger,

Therefore the <I>Self,</I>  as it were, split into a lighter and a shadier
part. The ambivalent Fox disunited and became two.<BR><BR> The change in
collective consciousness is reflected in the new rules of the game. The task of
the Geese (Soldiers) is to occupy the &quot;fort&quot; or the &quot;castle&quot;,
which is the nethermost square of the board. This area would signify the
unconscious (or divine) realm, including the <I>fourth unconscious</I> <NOBR><I>function</I><B>[<A
HREF="#inferior">9</A>]</B>.</NOBR> Although the rules still admit to winning
by enclosing the holy pieces, this is practically impossible. <BR><BR>The fort
consists of nine squares, which is significant, in itself. <NOBR>M-L v Franz</NOBR>
has shown that in fairytales <I>&quot;the number nine is found in the symbolism
of hell, the underworld and the realm of the dead&quot; </I>(cf. <NOBR>v Franz,</NOBR>
1997, p.135). Of course, this also makes possible the alternative interpretation
of the <I>combat myth,</I> namely the eternal battle between the <I>telluric</I>
and the <I>celestial</I> spirits, the spirits of darkness and the spirits of
light, as in the battle between demons and gods in Hindu mythology. However,
this is one of the many archetypes that underlie the psychic economy and the
integration of the unconscious, including the emergence of consciousness. Hence
an interpretation on my lines must at least be partly correct.<BR><BR>The two
guardians, as two Sphinxes guarding the gate, must try to ward off the forces of
consciousness. When the nether square, the fort, is filled with light pieces,
the unconscious fourth function will be conquered and the goal obtained. <NOBR>M-L
v Franz</NOBR> says:</FONT></P>

<TD><FONT FACE="Courier New">The great Egyptian primal god Atum was also
considered a lion who engendered the two lions (Shu and Tefnut), signifying
eternity and infinite time, respectively. This double lion (Shu-Tefnut) is
clearly Atum himself. <NOBR>Constant de Wit</NOBR> says: &quot;The double lion,
the two horizons, the two world mountains, are different images symbolizing the
crossing from life to death, from day to night and vice versa. They are the
guardians, the gates, the threshold to the Beyond...&quot;<BR>It is therefore
not surprising that they sometimes stand for the Beyond itself and sometimes for
the powers that effect its mystery. The double lion Routi is the divine
principle which, recreating itself in death, rises up from the dead.
Psychologically, the lion symbolizes psychic energy, <I>in its latent
unconscious condition, and its reappearance on the threshold of consciousness.</I><BR>Whenever
a latent unconscious content pushes up into consciousness, it appears first as a
twofold oneness <NOBR>(v Franz</NOBR>  1974,  <NOBR>p.93).</NOBR></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>
<P><FONT FACE="Courier New"> Historically, it's like the unconscious function,
because of a contrast effect, appears in company with an emancipation of
consciousness. The last evolution of the game reflects on our modern view of the
spiritual path, namely to view the unconscious as a psychic region, and then to
grapple with the forces of the unconscious, before we can attain the wholeness
when all the four functions of the psyche are integrated.

<I>Stratego</I> is likely the descendant of the French game <I>L'Attaque</I>
by Mademoiselle <NOBR>Hermance Edan,</NOBR> who filed a patent for this game in
1908. Concurrently with the rise of psychoanalysis and the new notion of the
<I>unconscious,</I> the pieces opposing the conscious forces are turned away
and effectively become unconscious to the player of the red pieces. The player
does not know what rank the enemy pieces have, and whether in confronting them
he is going to lose or win a piece. The <I>unconscious,</I> as it were, is
differentiated into several piece types, mirroring the increased knowledge of
unconscious entities and complexes. The absolute piece, which must be protected
at any cost, is retained in the form of the Flag.<BR CLEAR="left">
<BR><BR><B>Conclusion</B><BR><BR>C.G. Jung, the renowned Swiss
psychologist, regarded games as of the utmost importance to the sanity and
well-being of men and their societies. <I>&quot;Civilisations at their most
complete moments,&quot;</I> he said, <I>&quot;always brought out in man his
instinct to play and made it more inventive.&quot;</I> He would also point out
how in ancient Greece games had a religious origin (cf. Post 1978, <NOBR>p.45).</NOBR><BR><BR>The
boardgame represents a spiritual mystery, on alchemical lines a vessel in which
the spirit is captive, and this is where our fascination stems from. The
boardgame represents a dynamic form of <I>mandala,</I> an image of psychic
wholeness. The transformations in the collective psyche are mirrored in the
evolution of boardgame diagrams and rules.

quaternary nature, such as <I>mandalas.</I> <BR> The symbol of the <I>mandala</I>
has exactly this meaning of a holy place, a temenos, to protect the centre. And
it is a symbol which is one of the most important motifs in the objectivation of
unconscious images. It is a means of protecting the centre of the personality
from being drawn out and from being influenced from outside.[&quot;The Tavistock

rotation which also appears as a ritual <I>circumambulation.</I>
Psychologically, it denotes concentration on and preoccupation with a centre.&quot;
 [&quot;The Structure and Dynamics of the Self,&quot; CW 9ii, par. 352.]  (cf.
Sharp 1991)<BR><A NAME="self"><BR></A> 
<B>4.   Self.</B> The archetype of wholeness and the regulating center of the
psyche; a transpersonal power that transcends the ego.  [&quot;Definitions,&quot;
CW 6, par. 789.] <BR> The self is not only the centre, but also the whole
circumference which embraces both conscious and unconscious; it is the centre of
this totality, just as the ego is the centre of consciousness. [&quot;Introduction,&quot;
CW 12, par. 44.] <BR> Like any archetype, the essential nature of the self is
unknowable, but its manifestations are the content of myth and legend. <BR> The
self appears in dreams, myths, and fairytales in the figure of the &quot;supraordinate
personality,&quot; such as a king, hero, prophet, saviour, etc., or in the form
of a totality symbol, such as the circle, square, quadratura circuli, cross,
etc. When it represents a complexio oppositorum, a union of opposites, it can
also appear as a united duality, in the form, for instance, of tao as the
interplay of yang and yin, or of the hostile brothers, or of the hero and his
adversary (arch-enemy, dragon), Faust and Mephistopheles, etc. Empirically,
therefore, the self appears as a play of light and shadow, although conceived as
a totality and unity in which the opposites are united.[&quot;Definitions&quot;
CW 6, par. 790.] [...]<BR> Experiences of the self possess a numinosity
characteristic of religious revelations. Hence Jung believed there was no
essential difference between the self as an experiential, psychological reality
and the traditional concept of a supreme deity.  It might equally be called the
&quot;God within us.[&quot;The Mana-Personality,&quot; CW 7, par. 399.] (Sharp
1991).<BR><A NAME="quaternity"><BR></A>
<B>5. </B> <B>Quaternity. </B> An image with a four-fold structure, usually
square or circular and symmetrical; psychologically, it points to the idea of
wholeness. (See also temenos.) <BR> The quaternity is one of the most
widespread archetypes and has also proved to be one of the most useful schemata
for representing the arrangement of the functions by which the conscious mind
takes its bearings.[...] It is like the crossed threads in the telescope of our
understanding. The cross formed by the points of the quaternity is no less
universal and has in addition the highest possible moral and religious
significance for Western man. Similarly the circle, as the symbol of
completeness and perfect being, is a widespread expression for heaven, sun, and
God; it also expresses the primordial image of man and the soul.[&quot;The
Psychology of the Transference,&quot; CW 16, par. 405.] <BR> From the circle
and quaternity motif is derived the symbol of the geometrically formed crystal
and the wonder-working stone. From here analogy formation leads on to the city,
castle, church, house, and vessel. Another variant is the wheel (rota). The
former motif emphasizes the ego's containment in the greater dimension of the
self; the latter emphasizes the rotation which also appears as a ritual
circumambulation. Psychologically, it denotes concentration on and preoccupation
with a centre.[The Structure and Dynamics of the Self,&quot; CW 9ii, par. 352.]<BR>
 Jung believed that the spontaneous production of quaternary images (including
mandalas), whether consciously or in dreams and fantasies, can indicate the
ego's capacity to assimilate unconscious material. But they may also be
essentially apotropaic, an attempt by the psyche to prevent itself from
disintegrating. <BR> These images are naturally only anticipations of a
wholeness which is, in principle, always just beyond our reach. Also, they do
not invariably indicate a subliminal readiness on the part of the patient to
realize that wholeness consciously, at a later stage; often they mean no more
than a temporary compensation of chaotic confusion.[The Psychology of the
Transference,&quot; CW 16, par. 536.] (Sharp 1991)<BR CLEAR="left"><A
NAME="compensation"><BR></A><B>6.  Compensation. </B>  &quot;The unconscious
- and this is one of its essential <NOBR>properties - </NOBR>exerts a power of
compensation. Whereas under normal conditions consciousness responds to a
situation by an individual reaction adapted to outward reality, the unconscious
supplies a typical reaction, arising from the experience of mankind and
consonant with the necessities and laws of man's inner life. Thus it enables the
individual to take an attitude in conformity with the totality of the psyche&quot;

<I>&quot;One becomes two, two becomes three, and out of the third comes the one

whole process of individuation. One is the original state of unconscious
wholeness; two signifies the conflict between opposites; three points to a
potential resolution; the third is the transcendent function; and the one as the
fourth is a transformed state of consciousness, relatively whole and at peace
(Sharp 1991).<BR><A NAME="inferior"><BR>
</A><B>9.  Inferior function</B> (fourth function).  The least differentiated
of the four psychological functions. (Compare primary function.)  The inferior
function is practically identical with the dark side of the human personality.[&quot;Concerning
Rebirth,&quot; CW 9i, par. 222.] In Jung's model of typology, the inferior or
fourth function is opposite to the superior or primary function. Whether it
operates in an introverted or extraverted way, it behaves like an autonomous
complex; its activation is marked by affect and it resists integration.  The
inferior function secretly and mischievously influences the superior function
most of all, just as the latter represses the former most strongly.[&quot;The
Phenomenology of the Spirit in Fairytales,&quot; ibid., par. 431.] [...] <BR>
The essence of the inferior function is autonomy: it is independent, it attacks,
it fascinates and so spins us about that we are no longer masters of ourselves
and can no longer rightly distinguish between ourselves and others[&quot;The
Problem of the Attitude-Type,&quot; CW 7, par. 85.]  [...]<BR> To the extent
that a person functions too one-sidedly, the inferior function becomes
correspondingly primitive and troublesome. [...] When it becomes desirable or
necessary to develop the inferior function, this can only happen gradually. 
[...]<BR> Attempts to assimilate the inferior function are usually accompanied
by a deterioration in the primary function.[...] And yet it is necessary for the
development of character that we should allow the other side, the inferior
function, to find expression. We cannot in the long run allow one part of our
personality to be cared for symbiotically by another; for the moment when we
might have need of the other function may come at any time and find us
unprepared. [&quot;The Problem of the Attitude-Type,&quot; CW 7, par. 86.]
(Sharp 1991).<BR><A NAME="auxiliary"><BR></A><B>10.   Auxiliary function.</B>
A helpful second or third function, according to Jung's model of typology, that
has a co-determining influence on consciousness [...]<BR> The auxiliary
function is always one whose nature differs from, but is not antagonistic to,
the superior or primary function: either of the irrational functions (intuition
and sensation) can be auxiliary to one of the rational functions (thinking and
feeling), and vice versa.  Thus thinking and intuition can readily pair, as can
thinking and sensation, since the nature of intuition and sensation is not
fundamentally opposed to the thinking function. Similarly, sensation can be
bolstered by an auxiliary function of thinking or feeling, feeling is aided by
sensation or intuition, and intuition goes well with feeling or thinking. [&quot;General
