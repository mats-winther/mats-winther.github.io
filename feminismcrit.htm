<H1>A Critique of Feminism<br></H1><H5>On Women&rsquo;s Collective Shadow</H5>
<P><BR>
<I>Abstract:</I> Feminists eschew the demands of individuation.
According to female psychological authors, there is a tendency among women to
remain like little girls: they harbour a secret wish to be dependent on a strong man. Other than career
and material aspirations, women should turn to inner growth, in order to acquire a true
psychological independence. A forlorn &ldquo;moon consciousness&rdquo; ought to be
reconquered, which signifies the ability to exist in a symbolical realm, as women can be said to
be responsible for this side of existence.

<P><span class="bigger">Introduction</span><BR><BR>Are women truly liberated today? In medieval
times a person was regarded as fettered and enslaved in so far as he/she had an
obsession with worldly matters. The individual had then become subject to serfdom under
carnal powers. Today, curiously, it&rsquo;s the other way round. A woman is seen as
emancipated if she is worldly-minded, obsessed with carnality, and does what she likes. For example, a woman is
seen as &ldquo;free&rdquo; if she lives out her sexuality to the full. But in medieval
times she would be viewed as bound and fettered by carnality. So we have changed
our ideals. Some modern people, however, have experienced what serfdom under
worldly addiction means. Obsession with worldly career can also be addictive and develop into a
form of abuse.
<BR><BR> Although this is medieval pre-psychological thought, expressed in
religious terms, it remains the correct view of things. This is
what psychology has taught us, too. A liberated person is someone who has
achieved independence of psychological complexes and suffers no obsessions.
It means transcending the world, yet partaking in it, but this time not
obsessively.
<BR><BR> If feminists had learnt the lesson of psychology, they would know
what constitutes liberation, namely the integration of unconscious complexes.
Just because women in history have led a tragic existence, tied to domestic
duties, it doesn&rsquo;t mean that a surrender to unconscious life represents the
solution.
<BR><BR> From this point of view, feminism is anti-psychological as it has
turned this insight upside-down. As a result, the female collective has become chockingly
unconscious, decidedly worse off than in the Victorian era. In that time, one can
see from their letters (European women wrote much letters) that their
eros-consciousness was much more profound than today. Feminism has led women
out of the frying-pan into the fire.
<BR><BR><span class="bigger">Sun-consciousness&nbsp;&amp; moon-consciousness</span><BR><BR> The main
obstacle in feminist thinking is its obsession with material concerns, although the
problem is really at another level. The predicament in the Western world is
really that there is too much emphasis on the psychological &ldquo;sun principle&rdquo;,
whereas the &ldquo;moon spirit&rdquo; has been forgotten. The question of women&rsquo;s material
equality is secondary to this. The topical issue of
women priests exemplifies this. The true quandary is the <I>psychological</I> aspect of the
missing feminine, i.e. how the feminine spirit manifests in current social life and thought. Whether or not women should be allowed in the priest&rsquo;s pulpit is not a
burning question.
<BR><BR>Literalism is a typical sun quality. When the sun shines, everything
becomes clearly defined. Yet, mature thinking also makes use of the lunar
powers. In the moonshine things tend to meld together, and the landscape isn&rsquo;t
clearly defined anymore. A tree stump may become a troll. It is a landscape of
nature spirits. It is a great deficiency of our time that people have lost connection to moonlight consciousness. It does not signify an essentially different consciousness, but merely a toned down conscious function that allows unconscious forms to grow, along lines of historical mysticism. This is arguably what feminism should
focus on; the psychological aspects of femininity, rather than obsessing with
female material success and numerical equality.<BR><BR>I argue that the
subject matter becomes too enmeshed in materiality by keeping an overly strong focus on
worldly issues. As a consequence, the archetype of the feminine becomes projected on the material
world. The archetype plunges down into materiality, becomes vulgarized and
trivialized, which is what psychologist <SPAN class="nobr">Marie-Louise von Franz</SPAN> has warned
against. The feminine goddess is forgotten, actually. The feminists
have become obsessed with the material world and women&rsquo;s career issues, and have
forgotten about the archetype of the feminine. In fact, as modern people only learn to
think in terms of the visible and the material, it gives rise to a generation of
imbeciles.
<BR><BR>The effects of a one-sided sun-consciousness can be seen in the
following example. Recent law change in the state of Utah practically turns
women into incubators and rates their lives second to that of their unborn
child. Natural miscarriages could be subject to criminal proceedings. This is an
appalling development in the US. One can question how this can happen in a
civilized country.
<BR><BR>In the present time, we are lacking in
symbolical consciousness (cf. Winther, 2009, <A HREF="symbolic1.htm" TITLE="Symbolic Poverty">here</A>). As a consequence we are only capable of thinking in
nearly mathematical terms. Since it has all the bodily organs, a rationally
determined ethics accords the fetus with human value. This is a typical example
of &ldquo;sun-consciousness&rdquo;. Our inability in the symbolic realm has
divested us of the rituals, well-known to primitive man, by which the child is
taken up into the fellowship of men, thus acquiring manhood and full human
value. As a consequence, nothing matters except a rationalistic ethics. The
offense against the woman matters not either. So this is a form of
fundamentalism, because it displays this typical lack of &ldquo;moon
consciousness&rdquo;, which would allow people to live in a symbolical realm.<BR><BR>
Fundamentalist thought is on the increase in society. Feminists, for their part, lack insight into
areas of symbol formation and the unconscious. In practice, they work to repress female
nature and think only in terms of achievement. The fixation on categories of scientific sun-consciousness has led to moon-consciousness being repressed.
By example, on the radio I overheard a discussion about how to achieve gender
equality among elk hunters. Allegedly, there must be equally many female and male elk
hunters in the wood. But the argument that women ought to be involved to 50% in
everything is merely sterile mathematics. I am living in a country
that has practically adopted feminism as state ideology and am now seeing the
effects of it. It lacks relevance what is written in feminist philosophical books, &ldquo;for
every tree is judged by its fruit.&rdquo; 
<BR><BR><span class="bigger">Psychotherapist voices</span><BR><BR> 
Young women are today gradually losing their
mental health. Female
psychotherapists take note of women&rsquo;s unhappy condition. Von&nbsp;Franz (&ldquo;The Feminine in Fairy Tales&rdquo;, 1993) argues that &ldquo;[man] in our civilization is ahead of woman in the civilizing process&rdquo; (p.26). She discusses the &ldquo;obvious inferiority of women&rdquo; in today&rsquo;s world. 
Barbara&nbsp;Hannah (&ldquo;Encounters with the Soul&rdquo;, 1991) analyzes patients&rsquo; difficulties in taking psychological responsibility for their lives. A typical theme is that a woman must abandon her fixation on power, and affirm her longing to be &ldquo;overpowered&rdquo; by a man (p.226). 
<br><br>
Kathrin Asper (&ldquo;The Abandoned Child Within&rdquo;, 1993) points at certain problems in modern psychotherapy. It seems very difficult for some patients to achieve psychological autonomy through the conscious assimilation of their dark sides, and their shadow remains projected. Due to the fact that the feminine archetype is repressed in our time, a woman might find it hard to affirm her feminine nature. It results in a pathology of ego weakness, a hindrance to psychological maturation and an impediment for a successful therapy. 
<BR><BR>Colette Dowling (&ldquo;The Cinderella Complex&rdquo;, 1981) says that women rarely take a genuine responsibility for their
own lives.  They retain a childish wish of being tended on, like a sweet
princess. If they have the choice to put themselves in a situation of
psychological dependency, then they make this choice, rather than developing
their personality and talents.
<BR><BR> Liam Hudson &amp; Bernadine&nbsp;Jacot (&ldquo;The Way Men Think&rdquo;, 1991) say that women retain a dependency on the mother, whereas men have a much
stronger drive to break free. The authors say that the consequences of this are
enormous. Men can develop an &ldquo;abstract passion&rdquo; and a greater
individual freedom, thanks to the continual source of energy that the emancipative &ldquo;wound&rdquo;
provides. This means that men have a capacity of being objective, of seeing the
truth. Women have no big passion for truth.
<BR><BR> Marie-Louise von Franz (&ldquo;Archetypal Dimensions of the Psyche&rdquo;, 1999) says that the feminists are projecting their own inferior side (&ldquo;animus&rdquo;)
on their male superiors, and therefore regard them as tyrants (p.248). The phenomenon is
grounded in the repression of their own femininity to the advantage of their own
animus (their inner masculinity), which is covertly worshipped. Feminists are
therefore secretly attracted to the dominating male, and are unconsciously drawn
to tyrants, who are often chosen as partners. Unconsciousness always creates
this kind of repercussion.
<BR><BR><span class="bigger">Political consequences</span>
<BR><BR>Arguably, if women continue to
advance to power in society, the consequence is that society will undergo
infantilization, a danger discussed in my article &lsquo;An Intrusion of Matriarchal
Consciousness&rsquo; (<A HREF="matriarchal.htm" TITLE="An Intrusion of Matriarchal Consciousness">here</A>). There are already
too many infantile men in places of <SPAN class="nobr">power&thinsp;&mdash;</span>&thinsp;we don&rsquo;t need more people of this
ilk. In Sweden, Mona&nbsp;Sahlin aspires to become Prime Minister. She
is Sweden&rsquo;s foremost representative of &ldquo;political infantilism&rdquo;, said
<SPAN class="nobr">Kjell-Olof Feldt,</SPAN> a former Minister of Finance who belongs to the same
party. Former Prime Minister, G&ouml;ran&nbsp;Persson, belonging to
the same party, said that she virtually lacks the capacity to think for herself.
<BR><BR>Such people have as their foremost goal to encompass the whole of
humanity in a global Kindergarten. They are followers of diverse &ldquo;ideologies of unconsciousness&rdquo; that attempt to inhibit the emancipative drive present in the Western male, which liberates from unconscious identity. Therefore they have a fondness of immigrants from backward regions of the world, especially African
immigrants, who lack a strong drive of emancipation, and are often fully content
living in a motherly society.
<BR><BR>Feminism does not only damage women psychologically, it also poses a
danger in politics. Obviously, if women with an underdeveloped consciousness and
sophomoric outlook on life take charge of institutions and states, it will have destructive consequences. It is not the question that half the
population should be excluded from certain occupations; rather, certain people
should not be voted for. In the US, a woman named Sarah&nbsp;Palin
aspired at the Vice Presidency post. Suffice it to say 
that she doesn&rsquo;t belong in the White House. In earlier times, this was
self-evident, but thanks to feminism people actually see such a woman
as suitable for the presidency. Comparatively, should former heavy-weight
champion
Mike&nbsp;Tyson run for President, he wouldn&rsquo;t get many votes. His own
fans would understand that he doesn&rsquo;t belong in the
White House.
<BR><BR> Today, people repress the insight that women, as a rule, aren&rsquo;t
mature enough to take charge of power. As they haven&rsquo;t acquired psychological
independency, most women cannot produce genuinely  their own thoughts. They
have abandoned a way of thinking which is natural for themselves, and gone over
to parroting men. <BR><BR>Economical independency and
professional success acquired by women are factors that are being overestimated in
today&rsquo;s world. Women&rsquo;s inner souls haven&rsquo;t kept pace. The female
collective ought to devote more time to soul development, rather than grasping
for power. Arguably, in the female
collective, a long period of introversion is called for.
<BR><BR><span class="bigger">Psychological suffering</span>
<BR><BR>The female ideal is to be neurotically
obsessed with making a career, at daytime. During rest of the day, they should be neurotically
obsessed with sexual and romantic life. This explains the high prevalence of severely disturbed women in today&rsquo;s society. Luckily, woman has a refuge in
childbearing, which keeps her connected with Mother Earth. In my country, the
demands on young women have increased greatly, i.e. that they should be successful, beautiful,
as well as sexually experienced. As a consequence they
become depressed, cut themselves, and develop diverse forms of addiction. 
In today&rsquo;s media, the worsening state of young women is often discussed.
Many females solve their problem by practicing the well-known scapegoat stratagem.
These are the worst kind, the &ldquo;vampire women&rdquo;, discussed by von&nbsp;Franz (see below).
<BR><BR>The problem of psychological independency is especially pronounced
among immigrant females in Sweden. The younger among them tend to be oppressed and
victimized by family and relatives. Accordingly, they go to the social authorities and
require a new apartment at a secret address. However, after living alone for a
while they cannot tolerate their independent life anymore, so they tend to go back to their tyrant families,
who won&rsquo;t even allow them to visit a caf&eacute;. This is a notorious
phenomenon. Almost all victimized immigrant daughters go back to a miserable
existence, unable to develop psychological independency. They need
an authority to rule them.
<BR><BR> On the other hand, among Western feminists, this authoritarian <I>animus</I>,
being secretly worshipped, is projected onto men, who are then accused of being
tyrants. But it is really woman&rsquo;s own animus, her own unconscious masculinity. If women
could only admit that this is how they function, they could begin to grow and
develop. But as long as the conflict is retained and they persist in projecting
their own oppressor, who really represents their own longing after subservience,
then their neurosis will subsist.
<BR><BR> Of course, as women tend to suffer from this condition they have a
hard time thinking for themselves. They are inclined  to rely on authority
figures and diverse &ldquo;-isms&rdquo;, especially feminism. This is glaringly 
obvious to anybody having been part of an intellectual context. Hudson&nbsp;&amp;
Jacot explain that &ldquo;passionate abstraction&rdquo; derives from the <I>male
wound</I> obtained at the natural emancipation process, which has made the male
a creature <I>driven</I>. &ldquo;[The] wound leads the male mind to pursue
enterprises in the inanimate world with <SPAN class="nobr">intense&thinsp;&mdash;</span>&thinsp;and, at root,
intensely <SPAN class="nobr">personal&thinsp;&mdash;</span>&thinsp;passion.&rdquo; (Hudson&nbsp;&amp; Jacot, 1991, p.81)
Women lack this passion while they remain in symbiosis with the Mother.
<BR><BR>
<span class="bigger">Unconscious lifeway</span><BR><BR>An unconscious lifestyle will always have
evil consequences, as victimization and unconsciousness always go hand in hand.
Feminism belongs to the anti-psychological ideologies that support such a
development. I call them &ldquo;cocoon-theories&rdquo;, as they spin the subject
into a theoretical cocoon where he/she is sheltered from conscious realization.
Theory is used as protection against individual understanding; it&rsquo;s
a sort of armour. Thus, theory can be utilized as an automatic rejection mechanism,
whereby the truth is rebuffed. In this way the subject is relieved of the
painful process of becoming a true individual, something which would move
him/her out of comfortable identification with the group. Individuation is
experienced as so frightful that people resort to cocoon-theories, including the
solution of scapegoating and victimization, just to avoid becoming conscious.
<BR><BR> In this manner the stability of an inferior ego consciousness is
prolonged. In the near future, we will see an upsurge of evil and hatred, not
the least among women in the Western world. Behind the ideal of unconsciousness
the devil is gaining ground. A low conscious level notoriously brings up the
motif of murder. Characters such as &ldquo;Jihad&nbsp;Jane&rdquo; and &ldquo;Jihad&nbsp;Jamie&rdquo; are merely small indicators of
what&rsquo;s moving under the surface.
<BR><BR> Feminists have always supported a lifestyle of unconsciousness. For
instance, they have argued that a woman who gives expression to her sexuality to
the full, is a liberated woman. Truth is, she is capable of behaving like this
because she has no real comprehension of what she is doing. She has no other
concept of it than a pleasurable physical exercise. Thus, she is largely
unconscious of sexuality. The result is that her sexual life is obsessive and
neurotic, because it has formed an unconscious complex. She is caught up in an
enigma. Had she not been lacking in moral consciousness, she would have had a <I>problem</I>
instead, which is  much better than unconscious obsession. Conscious people have
problems, unconscious people have neuroses.
<BR><BR>Sexuality is something that resides on the
<I>inside.</I> Sexual maturity is not equal to sexual experience. Nobody
believes that a wino man is a wine connoisseur. Nobody should think that a
whore, or a modern-day sexually liberated woman, has insights into the spirit of
sexuality. If feminism had learnt the lesson of psychology, they would know
what constitutes liberation, namely the realization of unconscious contents,
leading to a higher <I>level of consciousness.</I> Thus, feminism has
made women more fettered than ever, by elevating an unconscious
ideal. <BR><BR><span class="bigger">Victimization</span><BR><BR>Collective unconsciousness in
humanity promotes murder-ideologies. I discuss this in my articles, &lsquo;The Blood Sacrifice&rsquo; (<A HREF="bloodsac.htm" TITLE="The Blood Sacrifice">here</A>), &lsquo;The Psychodynamics of Terrorism&rsquo; (<A HREF="terror.htm" TITLE="The Psychodynamics of Terrorism">here</A>), and &lsquo;Symbolic Poverty&rsquo; (<A HREF="symbolic1.htm" TITLE="Symbolic Poverty">here</A>). The act of killing symbolically represents the integration of an unconscious content with
consciousness, as exemplified in the Aztec blood sacrifice. It points at an
inner urge of conscious expansion. The drive toward individual consciousness is
a disruptive power, which is being placated when the motif of integration is
ritually manifested.
<BR><BR>Such horrific associations seem exaggerated, but bear in mind that the
motives obtain unconsciously, while victimization in the outer world often comes
to expression in more surreptitious ways, as exemplified by the very topical
vampire myth. <SPAN class="nobr">M-L von Franz</SPAN> says in &ldquo;Animus and Anima in
Fairy Tales&rdquo; (2002):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Regarding Rinkrank being a robber, it is one of the activities
of the animus life of a woman to steal, to suck life from other people. Such a
woman becomes a vampire because she has no life in herself. But she needs life
and so must take it where she finds it. The negative devil-animus kills every
feminine aspect of life. (pp.22-23)
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Notably, von Franz likens  this &ldquo;Rinkrank&rdquo;, an
unconscious factor in female life, to the pre-Christian Wotan, which underlied
the collective Nazi regression. Feminists don&rsquo;t like to recall women&rsquo;s role in
this. &lsquo;It was the women&rsquo;s vote&rsquo;, remarked Hermann&nbsp;Rauschning in
1939, &lsquo;that brought Hitler to triumph&rsquo;. This connection is paradoxical. Why
would emancipated women in the Weimar republic, in an atmosphere of sexual
liberation, and with constitutionally guaranteed equality, vote for a party that
was a dedicated opponent of female emancipation, that viewed females as inferior
beings whose main task was to bear children and look after the home? (cf.
Evans, 1976, pp.123f)
<BR><BR> The explanation might be what Dowling observes, namely a marked
female inclination toward psychological dependency. Instead of developing their
inner personality, women notoriously fall into the trap of ultimate male
chauvinism, symbolized by the fairytale figure Rinkrank. This would also explain
the paradoxical attraction, among women, for Islamism. The argument builds on an
unconscious factor present in the  female psyche itself. It is really the
fountainhead of &ldquo;masculoid  thinking&rdquo;, namely the negative animus,
which is the spectre  that possesses the feminists. What will happen in the
future, whenever a new Rinkrank appears on the political scene? <BR><BR> As
history shows, the lifestyle of unconsciousness always brings this consequence: the
motif of murder, and perhaps even cannibalism in some form. Cannibalism is also enacted
ritually in stealing, pulling out gold fillings in teeth, etc. The effects of an
ideology of unconsciousness is exemplified in Lutheranism. Martin&nbsp;Luther,
who invented the doctrine of &lsquo;sola fide&rsquo; or &ldquo;by faith alone&rdquo; asserts
that man is restored by faith or belief alone, to the exclusion of all human
efforts. Hence it&rsquo;s enough to believe in Stalin, or Mao&rsquo;s Little Red Book. An
anti-psychological ideology of unconsciousness is always compensated by the
motif of murder and cannibalism. Accordingly, Luther wrote to the heads of
states and urged them to take action in the Jew question (vid. Luther, 1543). His idea was to have their property and money
confiscated, have them drafted into forced labor, or expelled for all time. He even
advocates their murder, an idea which the Nazis later picked up. This shadowy
concept always accompanies the Kindergarten ideologies that expect all people to
be like sheep.
<BR><BR> In the Passion, the Christ is murdered, parted from his belongings,
and finally consumed in the Eucharist. This mythological image serves the
purpose of making people conscious of the archetype, to prevent them from
succumbing to it. That&rsquo;s why the Christ represents the truth. When the archetype
of conscious expansion, which is the dying god, emerges so strongly that it
takes possession of the personality, the Kindergarten companions will become murderous. In Mao&rsquo;s China, during the &ldquo;Cultural Revolution&rdquo;,
whenever a person was branded a traitor, people used to gather around, already
equipped with knives to cut themselves a piece of flesh.
<BR><BR><span class="bigger">Conclusion</span><BR><BR>By focusing on the outer world, &ldquo;social
action&rdquo;, etc., instead of taking responsibility of the inner soul, 
feminists circumvent the demands of individuation. On the inside, they remain
little girls who long after a &ldquo;strong man&rdquo; to assume control over
their lives. The argument builds on female psychological authors and their
experiences of women.
<BR><BR>An infantile collectivistic outlook on life, notorious among women and
immigrants from backward countries, will lead, firstly, to the evils of
harassment and mobbing, stealing and robbing (the procedure of torture), and
then to murder. These evils are on the increase in Western society, because
people more and more adhere to the ideal of an unconscious lifeway, instead of
taking responsibility for the development of their own personality.
<BR><BR>There is another alternative, for a woman, than putting herself in a
position of psychological dependence. Other than career and material
aspirations, she can turn to <I>inner growth</I>, to acquire a true <I>psychological</I>
independence. Economical independence is considerably overestimated. So my point is
that neither careerism nor being tied to domestic duties are good alternatives.
Feminism has damaged women, but the solution is not to take on the housewife
role again. Womankind should reconquer &ldquo;moon consciousness&rdquo;, as they
can be said to be responsible for this side of existence.<br><br>
I do not provide support for a backlash in women&rsquo;s issues. I take a stand against the 
feminine dependence on &ldquo;the strong man&rdquo;. My argument is that after having achieved 
<I>material independence,</I> women should now devote themselves to <I>psychological independence.</I> 
This calls for a period of introversion, which means that issues of economical status 
and position in society are toned down.</p>
