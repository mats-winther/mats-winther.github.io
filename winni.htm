<P><i>Abstract</i>: British psychoanalyst Donald&nbsp;W.&nbsp;Winnicott (1896-1971) developed an original
theory involving controversial  ideas such as the destruction of the patient and
the  merger of the subjective and objective worlds into a  whole. He argued that C.&#8239;G.&nbsp;Jung suffered from a severe  pathology, which affected his
theoretical outlook. This  article argues to the contrary: 
Winnicott&rsquo;s own theory displays a narcissistic kind of structure. His dream
appears to be an unconscious reaction against an unsupportable conscious
attitude. Winnicott is much concerned with how to defend against patients and
their invasive pathology. It functions as a system of defence for the psychologically
weak therapist; an attitude that is harmful to patients. The article contributes to the
understanding of narcissism.</P>

<P><br><SPAN class="shead">The dream</SPAN></P>
<P>In a letter to a colleague on 29 December 1963 Winnicott accounts for a
dream where he is immersed in the world and is part of all people (cf. Winnicott,
1989, pp.&#8239;228-30). But there are no object-relations going on anymore, only a
massive devastation of everything. Next he is himself the destructive agent, an
omnipotent power of destruction of the whole world. When beginning to wake up,
W. relates that <span class="nb">&ldquo;&hellip;I</span> first knew that I had a very severe headache. I could see
my head split right through, with a black gap between the right and left
halves. I found the words &lsquo;splitting headache&rsquo; coming and waking me
up, and I caught on to the appropriateness of the description&hellip;&rdquo; (p.&#8239;229).
Contextual to the latter part of the dream is a returning conscious fantasy that
he was unable to figure out. The fantasy said that he would be better if
somebody cleaved his head open from front to back and removed some defect part
of his brain.</P>
<P>In the following, W. starts expounding on Carl&nbsp;Jung&rsquo;s psychic
problems and makes the unconventional claim that he had dreamt this on behalf of
Jung, suggesting that the dream was commenting on Jung&rsquo;s psychic split,
allegedly deriving from childhood schizophrenia. W. also said that he had
the dream for some of his patients and, lastly, for himself.</P>
<P>Before this episode W. had written a review of Jung&rsquo;s autobiography
(Winnicott 1964; 1989, pp.&#8239;482-92) where he claims that Jung had suffered a
psychotic breakdown in his childhood. Due to this Jung had acquired a &lsquo;false
self&rsquo; and, allegedly, it is this split psychology that underlies his
theoretical views. W. comes to the conclusion that it was Jung&rsquo;s psychotic
illness that pushed him on to his exceptional achievement.</P>
<P>However, it is nowhere apparent that Jung had suffered such a severe
psychotic breakdown during childhood. The allegation that he suffered from a
pathological kind of double personality lacks substance, too. It seems fair to
assume that Winnicott&rsquo;s dream actually refers to himself and his own
psychic split. Also, it&rsquo;s likely that the part of his brain that needed to be
removed is a metaphor for many of his own ideas; as it were, a carcinogenic
cluster of erroneous thinking.</P>
<P><SPAN class="shead">Discussion</SPAN></P>
<P>Winnicott&rsquo;s theory intended to account for the whole of human culture with
notions of transitional objects/phenomena and transitional (potential) space
(v. Winnicott, 1999). The thinking is based upon the fact that children can be
said to exist in a vital space, occupied by objects that carry meaning and
magical power. In such a world, fully autonomous individuals have not yet
appeared. Instead, all beings interblend like the features of a landscape on a
moonlit night. Such an animistic space may give us some insight into how the
world looks from a child&rsquo;s perspective. W. heavily overextends his
theory.</P>
<P>W. holds to the view that the child and its mother form a unit, in the
earliest phase (cf. 1999, p.&#8239;107). As a consequence, if the mother is neurotic, the
child is immediately affected. The child, in a way, drinks in its mother&rsquo;s
problems with the mother&rsquo;s milk. On extending this view, a child can take over
its mother&rsquo;s neurotic symptoms and have her dreams.</P>
<P>This is the underlying reason why W. thinks he dreams on Jung&rsquo;s and also his
patients&rsquo; behalf. The potential space is no longer confined to the area &ldquo;in
between&rdquo; patient and analyst (and mother and child). It is expanded to
envelop a collective of people and, eventually, hypostatized into an <I>anima
mundi</I>. Having acquired the formidable capacity to tune in to this collective
potential space, it becomes possible for W. to experience other people&rsquo;s dreams.
W. is immersed in such a dreamlike, collectivistic, world that is now laid waste.
The eroding of subject and object, their immersion in a sea of  relationality,
is effectually the same as a destruction of the world, due to the extinction of
the ego. It&rsquo;s like a return to the chaotic condition prior to Creation.</P>
<P>But, more importantly, we may trace this image of destruction to Winnicott&rsquo;s
own thinking. W. expressly grants the destructive urge a positive value and sees
destruction as a means of establishing an independent existence of both parties
in the subject-object merger (cf. 1969; 1999, ch.&#8239;6). As he puts it, <span class="nb">&ldquo;&hellip;it</span> is
the destruction of the object that places the object outside the area of the
subject&rsquo;s omnipotent control&rdquo; (1999, p.&#8239;90). On this view, an object that
survives the destruction has acquired an independent value and can be &lsquo;used&rsquo;,
instead of merely related to, as is the case in the primary subject-object
merger.</P>
<P>W. defines object-relating as a state of fusion. This symbiotic condition is
broken by way of destruction of the object, whether it survives or not. The
object-relating then moves on to a more advanced cultural phase: <span class="nb">&ldquo;&hellip;the</span>
transitional object does not &lsquo;go inside&rsquo; [but] the transitional
phenomena have become diffused, have become spread out [over] the whole cultural
field&rdquo; (1953; 1999, p.&#8239;5). This process is continuous as &ldquo;the task of
reality-acceptance is never completed&rdquo; (1999, p.&#8239;13). Ultimately, the individual
 reaches a stage when only the most advanced transitional object is left. He
exists in a subject-object merger with the greatest teddy bear of all, namely the world
as such. As laid out in the dream, this world must now be destroyed. W. had
migrated all the way from mother&rsquo;s breast, via teddy and all transitional
objects in cultural expression, to the final stage of the world as a whole. Thus
he could dream for other people, as he was in a state of merger with them. The
infantile merger with the mother had been expanded to a merger with the world as
a whole. The regression to a godlike infantility is fulfilled. Finally, as the
world is destroyed, omnipotent object-relating changes into grandiose
object-use. A wholly godlike grandiosity is established.</P>
<P>Normally, interpreting third-party dreams is a precarious undertaking, but
in this case it&rsquo;s not far-fetched to think that the dream is Winnicott&rsquo;s
unconscious revolt against his own conscious standpoint. What must be removed
from his head is a carcinogenic id&eacute;e fixe; an unsound way of thinking
metaphorically expressed as a carcinoma or defect brain tissue. It&rsquo;s an attempt
at healing during which his head is crudely split open to remove a grossly defective
mental outlook.</P>
<P><SPAN class="shead">Narcissistic mysticism</SPAN></P>
<P>The symbiotic and destructive cycle, and its expansion into society, became
central to W. He asserts that before a certain date, say a thousand years ago,
men did only exceptionally attain <i>unit status</i> (cf. 1999, p.&#8239;70). They soon lost, at
the end of childhood, their sense of being individuals. Previously, men always
existed in an object-relational identity with the transitional objects of
community. They never went past the symbiotic stage into object-usage, and then
on to a more developed object-relation, etc. The little child tears teddy&rsquo;s head
off and, accordingly, destroys the object-relation. This, allegedly, gives him
unit status. But earlier in history people lacked the capacity to &ldquo;decapitate&rdquo;
the transitional objects characteristic of maturity. The individual remained in
a symbiotic subject-object merger.  In the modern day, however, the child&rsquo;s
destructive ability may be kept alive by viewing the cultural world of the adult
as a form of playground, not essentially different from that of kindergarten.
Winnicott&rsquo;s wife Clare attests to the central importance of the aspect of cyclic
destruction and of adult life as playing activity  (cf. 1989, p.&#8239;3f).</P>
<P>The fantasy of omnipotence along with the aggressive destructive urge is
reminiscent of the psychology of the narcissistic character disorder (NPD). It could
be argued that W. portrays the dynamic of a narcissistic relationship. A
narcissistic man, for instance, might victimize his spouse and, as an interlude,
treat her as a princess (v. Forward&nbsp;&amp; Torres, 1986). The latter phase
pertains to the recurrent symbiotic condition. Symbiosis is merely another way
of removing the Other as an antagonist to ego domination. The motif of control
and exploitation is interchanged with subject-object merger. The relationship
always needs to be renewed by way of a new destruction, or as Clare&nbsp;Winnicott says, <span class="nb">&ldquo;&hellip;the</span> destroying of the object in unconscious
fantasy is like a cleansing process, which facilitates again and again the
discovery of the object anew. It is a process of purification and renewal&rdquo;
(Winnicott, 1989, p.&#8239;3f). The reason why we have to continually destroy the other
party in fantasy is because he/she must be repossessed as an  external object of
usage. The destruction serves the purpose of recovering his/her status as
external object. Otherwise a projective situation will prevail, which means that the other
person is not recognized for his/her true characteristics. This process is
evident in the analyst&rsquo;s &ldquo;hatred of the patient&rdquo; (1958, p.&#8239;147). The analytic
merger must be followed by destruction, at the end of the analytic session.</P>
<P>Brought to its extreme, this fantasy generates the peculiar inverted form of
individuation that was described above. Pre-natal or pre-animistic wholeness is
restored by way of worldly omnipotence followed by destruction. Such ideas have
an ominous power that  must not be underestimated. They are characteristic of
the apocalyptic suicide sects that have surfaced during the latest decades: Jim&nbsp;Jones and the Peoples&rsquo; Temple, David&nbsp;Koresh and
the Branch Davidians, Marshall&nbsp;Herff&nbsp;Applewhite and the Heaven&rsquo;s
Gate, etc. Reverend Jim&nbsp;Jones&rsquo;s thinking is properly described as
a narcissistic form of mysticism. He gradually expanded his ego territory until
he finally revealed to his adepts that he was God. There followed the infamous
mass suicide in Guyana, 1978, where at least 910 people including at  least 270
children were killed. Already in the early years of the cult a suicide ritual
was established. A drink was dealt out that was said to contain poison (v.
Kilduff, 1978). As the proselytes didn&rsquo;t die the leader relieved them from their
anguish by admitting that it was  not true. It was a device to test their
loyalty. Only at the fatal date the drink contained real poison. This
hair-raising ritual is consistent with the dynamic of a repetitive destruction.</P>
<P>A customary theme is the attainment of world-transcendence. Following the
holocaust, life is continued in an otherworldly sphere. In Winnicott&rsquo;s thinking
the destructive act implies transcending the object, moving out of the
symbiotic domain. Ultimately, in narcissistic mysticism, it means transcending
the world.</P>
<P><SPAN class="shead">Destruction</SPAN></P>
<P>W. said that he observed this process with little infants. The baby
exists in a merger with mother when suckling mother&rsquo;s breast. This is followed
by attempts to destroy the breast by biting. According to W. this is a first
attempt to establish the quality of externality. Again, the aggressive impulse
is understood as positive (cf. Winnicott, 1969; 1999, ch.&#8239;6). Is it possible that W.
projected the destructive will on the infant? When a baby bites it&rsquo;s often
because the breast is empty or he has had enough to eat and is bored. It may
also be due to a stressful environment. Biting is most often simply a protest.</P>
<P>Leaving aside that Winnicott&rsquo;s premises, drawn from infancy, are somewhat
infirm, we must now ask ourselves to what degree his concepts refer to
commonplace psychodynamics. Is &lsquo;destruction&rsquo; just a figure of speech? Is
&lsquo;hating&rsquo; the patient merely a metaphorical expression for an ordinary
dismissal? When he speaks about &lsquo;using&rsquo; other people, does he really mean
&lsquo;exploiting&rsquo; them? W. denies that using means exploiting (cf. 1999, p.&#8239;94). He says
that we use each other just as we use our homes, or use a therapist. Exploiting
people would imply using other  people to their own disadvantage. However, if
the therapist doesn&rsquo;t receive his payment it could certainly be called
exploitation. It seems like the notion of using is not so far from exploitation.
The term using is equal to exploiting in the neutral sense. It&rsquo;s saddening that
there is no mention of a third form of rapport, a relation between adults that
is neither symbiotic nor exploitative in the neutral sense.</P>
<P>W. says there is no anger in the destruction of the object (cf. 1999, p.&#8239;93). On
the other hand, he also says that there is an aggressive impulse behind it and
he employs the rather strong word &lsquo;hate&rsquo;:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The analyst&rsquo;s hate is ordinarily latent and is  easily kept so. In analysis
of psychotics the analyst  is under greater strain to keep his hate latent, and 
he can only do this by being thoroughly aware of it.  I want to add that in
certain stages of certain   analyses the analyst&rsquo;s hate is actually sought by
the  patient, and what is then needed is hate that is  objective. If the patient
seeks objective or  justified hate he must be able to reach it, else he  cannot
feel he can reach objective love.<BR><BR>
It is perhaps relevant here to cite the case of  the child of the broken
home, or the child without  parents. Such a child spends his time unconsciously 
looking for his parents. It is notoriously inadequate  to take such a child into
one&rsquo;s home and to love him.  What happens is that after a while a child so
adopted  gains hope, and then he starts to test out the  environment he has
found, and to seek proof of his  guardians&rsquo; ability to hate objectively. It
seems that  he can believe in being loved only after being hated. (1958, p.&#8239;199)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>When they are ripe for it, certain psychotics and traumatized children must
be expressly hated, not only hated and destroyed in fantasy. The point is that
these cases must learn to hate and destroy in order to be able to create the
quality of externality. Only then, other people will become external objects of
usage, a condition that W. connects with objective love.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Sentimentality is useless for parents, as it  contains a denial of hate, and
sentimentality in a  mother is no good at all from the infant&rsquo;s point of  view.
<BR><BR>
It seems to me doubtful whether a human child as  he develops is capable of
tolerating the full extent  of his own hate in a sentimental environment. He 
needs hate to hate.
<BR><BR>
If this is true, a psychotic patient in analysis  cannot be expected to
tolerate his hate of the  analyst unless the analyst can hate him. (1958, p.&#8239;202)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The adopted child must not be loved (treated sentimentally) because he/she would
then become symbiotic with mother and family, due to his strong longing for love
and tenderness. It then arises a strong urge in the child to create externality.
But as hate is intolerable he lacks the tool to accomplish this. What follows is
a continual trying of the parents&rsquo; patience in order to provoke hatred and, only
then, hatred will become an acceptable phenomenon. The rationale behind this is
that the child is impelled to establish a narcissistic dynamic of hatred and
symbiotic merger, directed outwards. By this it evades the regressive merger
with the mother. Of course, the first thing that will happen is that he becomes
a bully at school where he chooses a victim to  continually destroy.</P>
<P>What drives narcissism is a negative mother complex (v. Jacoby, 1985). An
individual that cannot, for whatever reasons, accomplish a proper emancipation
(&ldquo;resolve the Oedipus complex&rdquo;) might employ a next best solution. The
narcissistic solution implies a continual unconscious struggle against the
mother. The bipolar pattern of destruction and merger keeps him from regression
to infantility. It is an inferior, pathological solution; still, it is a
solution. If the parents are lacking in loving devotion of the needful child,
this could very  well be the outcome. Instead of developing psychic symptoms
that would render him incapable of going on in life, the child develops the
relatively stabile narcissistic pattern. Narcissists often develop a  
considerable ability in their trade (cf. Kernberg, 1975, p.&#8239;229).</P>
<P>W. is quite sincere. It&rsquo;s not simply that he makes a controversial choice of
words. He even wants to substitute Freud&rsquo;s sexual libido with his impulse of
destruction:</P>
		<BLOCKQUOTE>
In adult and mature sexual intercourse, it is  perhaps true that it is not
the purely erotic  satisfactions that need a specific object. It is the 
aggressive or destructive element in the fused   impulse that fixes the object
and determines the need  that is felt for the partner&rsquo;s actual presence, 
satisfaction, and survival. (Winnicott, 1958, p.&#8239;218)</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Sexuality is a means of destroying the other party and overcoming the
subject-object merger. The partner&rsquo;s actual presence is realized. Again, the
partner should be thankful that he/she is subjected to aggression because that&rsquo;s
how his/her independent existence is manifested. Of course, in reality, only the
subject himself  experiences the merger (and the termination of it). But, as W.
postulates the existence of a space of symbiotic merger, a potential space, it
is assumed that the other party is enmeshed in this experience, too.</P>
<P>A sadistic element in sexuality is brought out here. It is certainly true
that sexuality has this destructive capacity. This might shed some light on the
narcissistic obsession with sexuality, as the cases of Jim&nbsp;Jones and David&nbsp;Koresh bear witness to.</P>
<P>According to Brett&nbsp;Kahr (2000) a considerable number of Winnicott&rsquo;s patients
committed suicide when undergoing analysis. We don&rsquo;t know whether these patients
were psychotics that were subjected to Winnicott&rsquo;s express hatred or whether
they were neurotics who only needed to be destroyed covertly. We only know that
the destructive fantasy sometimes came true. Naturally, there is no way of
proving that it had anything to do with Winnicott&rsquo;s attitude. Nevertheless, his
uncalled-for destruction of Jung (cf. Winnicott, 1964; 1989, pp.&#8239;482-92) is evidence
that he expressly applied his theory. W. found much inspiration in Jung&rsquo;s
books and, presumably, he had to be destroyed in order to terminate the
subject-object merger. Anna&nbsp;Freud reported that W.
<span class="nb">&ldquo;&hellip;wrote</span> such a hostile and denigrating review of one of my books for an
official journal here that it was refused. And afterwards he said that he was
sorry, he did not know why he had done it, he really liked the book. So that
is how it is&rdquo; (Kahr, 1996, p.&#8239;112, Loc. Cit.). The considerable intellectual and
moral calibre of Anna&nbsp;Freud, and the fact that W. liked the book,
could, perchance, explain why she needed to be destroyed.</P>
<P><SPAN class="shead">Ego-Self merger</SPAN></P>
<P>The notion of ego-Self merger (v. <SPAN class="nobr">Schwartz-Salant,</SPAN> 1982)
implies that the ego is not fully liberated from archaic or infantile identity.
The individual and collective psyche are, to some degree, fused together (v.
Jung, 1972, pars.&#8239;240ff). A likely explanation for the bipolar dynamic is that it
constitutes a defence against inflation, that is, at both ends there is imminent
danger to the ego system. Kernberg says that the defensive operations of
omnipotence and devaluation are  means of protection against threatening needs
and involvement with others (cf. Kernberg, 1975, pp.&#8239;101-102). It goes together with
a chronic feeling of emptiness due to a severe lack in the sense of personal
identity (ch.&#8239;7). There are also narcissistic patients whose pathological
narcissism constitutes an important defence against a primitive paranoid
tendency (cf. p.&#8239;219).</P>
<P>The polarized organization of personality follows from the fusion of
personal and collective. Jung says that &ldquo;[if] we make the mistake of including
the collective psyche in the inventory of personal psychic functions, a
dissolution of the personality into its paired opposites inevitably follows.
Besides the pair of opposites already  discussed, megalomania and the sense of
inferiority, which are so painfully evident in neurosis, there are many
others&hellip;&rdquo; (Jung, 1972, para.&#8239;237).</P>
<P>It seems as if narcissism is a condition where the collective and personal
psychic spheres are not thoroughly separated. It is a chronic neurosis elevated
to lifestyle. It can remain static and even seemingly unneurotic thanks to a
sadistic dynamic or a pattern of grandiosity-idealization versus inferiority.
If the defensive pattern is not upheld, a serious affliction is likely to occur.
Jung maintains that when the ego gets assimilated to the Self, a mystical,
dreamlike state ensues. The subject feels he is immersed in a space-time
continuum that is characteristic of the unconscious as such. Secondly, the Self
may become assimilated to the ego. This also results in inflation, as the world
of collective consciousness is overvalued (cf. Jung, 1978, pars.&#8239;45-47). If the
primordial images are projected, Jung relates, the subject vacillates between
deification and hateful contempt. On the other hand, if the images are
introjected, he gets involved in self-deification or in a moral self-laceration
(cf. Jung, 1972, para.&#8239;110). It&rsquo;s imperative, then, to differentiate the ego from the
collective  psyche.</P>
<P>Jung says that &ldquo;&hellip;the collective and the personal psyche may be fused
together, with, as I have intimated, highly unfortunate results. Through his
identification with the collective psyche he will infallibly try to force the
demands of his unconscious upon others&hellip;&rdquo; (1972, para.&#8239;240). Perhaps, even,
the patient will be able to convince others that they need to be destroyed so
that they can attain world-transcendence.</P>
<P>The notion of &lsquo;projective identification&rsquo; (v. Kernberg, 1975) is often used
in this circumstance. It implies that the subject is, to a pathological degree,
shackled to the receiver of the projection. By example, the subject does not
simply pass by the person that just activated his projection, but instead
starts stalking him. He is bound to him, so to speak, and must compulsively
continue the bedevilment. Typically, the narcissist would be quite friendly,
even charismatic, at first. However, after a while, he would continue the
bedevilment, typically attributing mental disorder to his victim. Many
narcissistic men, after the wedding is consummated and the woman is dependent on
the man, economically, emotionally and residentially, show their  true intent:
to transfer their own split-off psyche on the victim.</P>
<P><SPAN class="shead">The differentiated Self</SPAN></P>
<P>Peculiar to Jungian psychology is the view that the healthy Self obtains a
high level of autonomy. As such, the Self is not concretely encountered in the
external world but is established as an inner autonomous factor, as a feeling of
wholeness that transcends the ego. When wholeness is inside, as a strong sense
of self, symbiotic identification with the collective loses its alluring power.
The opposite pitfall of narcissistic, grandiose, &lsquo;unit status&rsquo; is avoided, too.
The healthy individual never experiences that he is fully divided against the
collective. As this wholeness inside remains autonomous, i.e. transcends the
ego, the ego can never obtain supreme ascendancy.</P>
<P>A good illustration of the healthy configuration is the following dream,
recounted by a smallholder&rsquo;s wife who lived a strenuous life (Hillerdal, 1983, p.&#8239;74). In the dream, she was on her way to work in the field when she felt that
Jesus walked by her side in ankle-length garment. She was not able to turn
her head and look at Him, but Jesus worked with her all day in the field and she
felt happy and at peace. She recounts that this dream had helped her many times
during all days of hard toil under the hot sun.</P>
<P>The dream establishes a proper self-feeling. The Self is expressed as
something that does not belong to the ego. Nor does it belong to the outer world
and is not projected on other people. She cannot look at Him because the Self
transcends ego consciousness. It&rsquo;s beyond a total comprehension. Yet, the Self
is always there and partakes in her toil. Here is an example where the Self
motivates the ego and gives it energy and love of live. There is no interaction
between the two. They don&rsquo;t talk and they don&rsquo;t look at each other. She just
feels His presence.</P>
<P>Another example is of a woman who was struck with depression at the
assassination of John&nbsp;F.&nbsp;Kennedy (Hillerdal, 1973, p.&#8239;16). She talked
with different religious and political organizations, but afterwards she     
still felt despairing. For the first time in her life she attended church.
During service she suddenly felt the presence of Jesus. He stood beside her and
radiated power and consolation. She experienced his words, not as sounds, but
directly inside her: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t despair. You&rsquo;re not alone. I live.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The ego is no longer bound to the Self. The projection on Kennedy is
withdrawn and the ego is emancipated. Due to this she learns to know about the
Self for the first time. It is as if the Self stands beside her. It is not
herself, yet it is her own Self. She cannot see Him or hear Him audibly. He
transcends her conscious faculty. She simply feels His presence. There are many
experiences of this kind recounted: a rather unpretentious experience of Jesus
as the silent bystander or silent co-worker.</P>
<P>In his autobiography Jung relates his early experience of his No.&#8239;1 and No.&#8239;2
existences. Jung, in those days, renounced any identification with No.&#8239;2, whom he
experienced as an archaic superior intelligence. At the same time he took the
decision not to deny No.&#8239;2. He would  always remember him. He says:</P>
		<BLOCKQUOTE>
This dream was a great illumination for me. Now I  knew that No.&#8239;1 was the
bearer of the light, and that No.&#8239;2 followed him like a shadow. My task was to 
shield the light and not look back at the vita peracta; this was evidently a
forbidden realm of  light of a different sort. (Jung, 1965, p.&#8239;88)</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This is a similar situation as in the above experiences of Jesus. The ego is
differentiated from the Self, yet the Self remains an invisible follower that
cannot be looked at. There is only a &lsquo;sensing&rsquo; of the Self (cf. Jung, 1972, para.&#8239;405).</P>
<P>Nonetheless, this autobiographical episode is the reason why W. diagnosed
Jung, along with his theory, as pathological, arguing that Jung&rsquo;s No.&#8239;1 is an
example of an acquired &lsquo;false self&rsquo;. Commenting on Jung&rsquo;s autobiography, he
says:</P>
		<BLOCKQUOTE>
There are plenty of troubles of other kinds for  the unit personality,
though for the unit personality  the word self has a clear meaning that does not
need  explaining.<BR><BR>
It is truly difficult for those with healthy unit  personalities to achieve
empathy with those whose  divided selves give them constant trouble. (Winnicott, 
1964, p.&#8239;455; 1989, pp.&#8239;482-92)</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>We are now ripe for making the conclusion that it is, in fact, the other way
round. The &lsquo;unit personality&rsquo; that W. refers to is an abnormal ego, a
pathological merger of ego and Self, since there exists no &ldquo;No.&#8239;2&rdquo;. The
abnormal ego harbours opposites that really should be located in the Self
(expressed in religious terms as &lsquo;Christ lovingly carries our suffering&rsquo;). By
forcing the internal conflict upon others, and punishing the very people he has
&lsquo;merged&rsquo; with, the narcissist &lsquo;survives&rsquo; as he has revitalized his &lsquo;unit
status&rsquo;. The negative mother complex is ever threatening him and he fears a
regressive merger with the mother. By instead merging with others and then
destroying them, he creates the well-known pattern of vicarious suffering. He is
temporarily released from inner tension, but the cycle must be repeated.</P>
<P>Jung&rsquo;s &ldquo;divided self&rdquo;, on the other hand, represents a sound configuration of ego and <SPAN class="nobr">Self&thinsp;&mdash;</span>&thinsp;at least it&rsquo;s better. Jung sometimes compares ego and Self with
earth and sun. The earth can harbour life only because it is located at a
respectable distance from the sun. The Jungian view of ego and Self is a
healthy and non-narcissistic model of the psyche. By comparison, Kohut adopts
the &lsquo;bipolar self&rsquo; (idealized self and grandiose-exhibitionistic self) as a
natural and largely positive phenomenon (v. Kohut, 1977). The application of a 
model of the psyche that is, as such, more or less narcissistic, implies that
the least severe form of narcissism is seen as sound and normal.</P>
<P><SPAN class="shead">The unit personality</SPAN></P>
<P>The notion of &lsquo;unit personality&rsquo;, employed by W. as an ideal, has
actually been much discussed. Richard&nbsp;Sennett (1992) says that the obsession with finding
a unified self-image is pathological. Adolescents, especially, are often very
focused on finding collective rules with which they build their identity (cf. p.&#8239;125). He discusses young psychiatrists and says:</P>
		<BLOCKQUOTE>
Recently two American researchers, Daniel&nbsp;Levenson and Myron&nbsp;Sharaf, did a study of a peculiar  phenomenon among these
young doctors. This was the  tendency shown by many beginning psychiatrists to 
think of themselves as little gods, sitting in  judgement on their patients and
slightly contemptuous  of them. The attitude, which Levenson and Sharaf  called
the psychiatrists&rsquo; omnipotence desire, is of  course not universal, but it is
frequently to be  found among newly practicing therapists.<BR><BR>
In the process of their research Levenson and  Sharaf concluded that this
little-god complex  occurred partially out of a great fear these new 
practitioners had that they might be hurt by becoming involved with the
problems of their patients,  involved in a painful way so deeply that their own 
sense of themselves would dissolve. [These] young  doctors have exerted a
peculiar kind of <SPAN class="nobr">strength&thinsp;&mdash;</span>&thinsp;a  power to cut themselves off from the world
around them, to make themselves distant, and perhaps lonely,  by defining
themselves in a rigid way. This fixed  self-definition gives them a strong
weapon against  the outer world. They prevent a pliant traffic  between
themselves and men around them and so acquire a certain immunity to the pain of
conflicting and  tangled events that might otherwise confuse and  perhaps even
overwhelm them. (Sennett, 1992, pp.&#8239;5-6)</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>A recent study (McGabe et al., 2002) shows that doctors indicate reluctance
to engage with psychotic patients&rsquo; symptoms as a topic of conversation. They
hesitated and avoided answering the patients&rsquo; questions. The doctors&rsquo; use of
laughter <span class="nb">&ldquo;&hellip;indicated</span> embarrassment when faced with such delicate questions
from patients about the causes of their distress&rdquo;.</P>
<P>These defensive patterns function as a defence of the relatively weak ego
system. The notion of &lsquo;ego strength&rsquo; implies a relative capacity to endure
conflict and pain in consciousness, that is, there is a readiness to confront
circumstances where one is not in total control. Such a person has &ldquo;the
integrity to be confused&rdquo;. The pain can be endured because there is no risk
of dissolution and regression. Sennett explains that persons lacking in ego
strength instead absorb themselves in the oneness of the self.</P>
		<BLOCKQUOTE>
For by turning one&rsquo;s energies to an ideal of  oneness, the enemies of
purity, the disjointed,  confusing experiences of interaction in the everyday 
world, can be dismissed as of lesser importance, and  the young person can, like
Malraux&rsquo;s character Hong,  imagine himself strong because he refuses to let 
himself be challenged.<BR><BR>
[Some] adolescents do have the strength to hold themselves back, and let a
diversity of painful,  confused, and contradictory new experiences enter  their
lives, before they take the active steps that  will confirm them in an identity.
But most young  people are denied the strength to endure ambiguity of  this
kind&hellip; (Sennett, 1992, p.&#8239;23; p.&#8239;37)</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>It&rsquo;s interesting to note that psychologists have arrived at an understanding
of &lsquo;ego strength&rsquo; that contradicts the popular image of a strong, self-assured,
person that is experienced in the ways of the world and always knows what to do.</P>
<P>The &lsquo;unit personality&rsquo; may survive into adulthood. It may grow into a
pattern where &lsquo;otherness&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t tolerated but must be hated and destroyed and
&lsquo;unit status&rsquo; always reconquered. This is, like Jung says, connected with an
overvaluation of consciousness. The urge to find ways to fit in is so strong
that people program themselves according to the expectations of the outer world.
The demands of the outer world may even be such that there is no room for
introversion or slight unassuredness. Paradoxically, a young person that is
thoroughly exposed to the world and trains himself in all the mannerisms and
the collective way of thinking, is likely to become psychosocially inferior,
because he is a collective being and has not managed to develop a true personal
identity. Due to overvaluation of consciousness there is a great risk that the
Self becomes assimilated to the ego. A  strong ego, on the other hand, is
differentiated from the collective.</P>
<P>The way W. theoretically solves the problem of individuation is to
amalgamate the inner and outer into one world: the transitional space of play.
For children and grown-ups alike, the only way of discovering the self (the unit
personality) is by creative play in an amalgamated sphere of inner and outer
(cf. 1999, p.&#8239;54).</P>
		<BLOCKQUOTE>
And on the basis of playing is built the whole of  man&rsquo;s experiential
existence. No longer are we either  introvert or extrovert. We experience life
in the  area of transitional phenomena, in the exciting  interweave of
subjectivity and objective observation, and in an area that is intermediate
between the inner reality of the individual and the shared reality of  the
world that is external to individuals. (1999, p.&#8239;64)</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Goethe wisely insisted that man must accept living in two worlds, the inner
and the outer. But W. is not willing to accept that man must live in two worlds.
Instead, the merger of ego and Self, the unit personality, becomes an ideal.
When the collective unconscious (using Jung&rsquo;s vocabulary) is not acknowledged in
its own right, it must  needs creep in the backdoor in the form of a vital space
that contaminates the outer world. This causes objects and people to become
animated, turning them into transitional objects of playful merger and
destruction. The animation of the world is really a prolongation of the child&rsquo;s
world, something that W. wanted to perpetuate (see above). Such a longing often
originates from an initial overestimation of collective consciousness, something
that will be paid for because the unconscious will finally find its way back in
negative form. As Jung says, the subject comes to feel he is immersed in a
space-time continuum that is characteristic of the unconscious as such.</P>
<P>The idea of a spiritual communion really belongs to the world of the inner
Self. Such a mystical field of a longed-for interconnectedness; man to man and
man to God, must not be allowed to contaminate the entire outer world of the
ego. This must needs lead to a merger of ego and Self. When childhood is left
behind the splitting of the world must be accepted. This means that the
individual will always find resort in an inner world when he cannot fully cope
with the outer. Sennett says that <span class="nb">&ldquo;&hellip;losing</span> the feeling of being omnipotent is
the birth of feeling personally strong in another way. [Although] an adult
feels no longer wholly the manipulator of the world around him he also feels
that that world cannot in turn wholly manipulate him&rdquo; (Sennett, 1992, pp.&#8239;116-17). So he has found an inner space that is a place of refuge. This  is a
stable condition where neither omnipotence nor unit status needs to be
cyclically reiterated.</P>
<P><SPAN class="shead">Conclusion</SPAN></P>
<P>Winnicott is today on the reading lists of many university courses. He
notoriously crops up in the psychological journals. Historically, the Freudian
tradition has been hampered by its devotion to  rationalistic and reductive
thinking, and not much room has been left to man&rsquo;s spiritual side. This explains
Winnicott&rsquo;s longstanding popularity. He presents us with a pseudo-spiritual
perspective, as a substitute for Jung&rsquo;s notion of the collective unconscious.
Psychology, it is  true, has to cope with the yearning of the spirit. The
individual wants to find his place in the overall picture and there is a healthy
longing after a spiritual communion. But this longing mustn&rsquo;t be allowed to robe
in scientific terminology. Potential space is a mere heuristic notion and it
should not be allowed to swell outside the consulting room or nursery.</P>
<P>Winnicott&rsquo;s teaching is a defensive system designed for the narcissistic
psychotherapist. It is not beneficial to the suffering patient. Even little
homeless children must be defended against, says W. How do young doctors react
to Winnicott&rsquo;s ideas of hatred and  destruction? Evidently, it&rsquo;s not uncommon to
find narcissistic streaks among, especially, young doctors. In W. some of
them will find support for a destructive attitude towards the patient. Patients
will get hurt and the immature doctor might think that his attitude actually
makes a good example. For the sake of the psychic health of both patients and
therapists it&rsquo;s high time that Winnicott&rsquo;s greatly overblown dimension is
strongly reduced. His own dream points at this necessity.</P>

<H2>Addendum</H2><P></P>
<P>
Can Winnicott be fitted into an overarching psychoanalytic theory? There are ominous aspects of Winnicott&rsquo;s psychology involving the &ldquo;merger with&rdquo; and the &ldquo;destruction of&rdquo; the patient. Winnicott&rsquo;s notions fly in the face of our traditional sense of morality and they radically deviate from traditional psychoanalysis. How can we come to grips with the fact that his flagrantly immoral and highly unorthodox theories keep popping up? I hold that Winnicott&rsquo;s theory is pertinent to a certain kind of psychic economy that is backward in relation to modern man. Mankind is stratified on different levels of mental culture or psychic economy, representing different stages in our historical evolution. The psyche is moulded by an inborn factor of mental culture, and not only by individual experiences and personality characteristics. Thus, we must have recourse to an exclusive model for each kind of psychic economy. It would help to solve the dilemma of whether or not W. is an integral part of psychoanalysis. 
<br><br>
The notions of &lsquo;projection&rsquo; and &lsquo;transference&rsquo; take on a completely different meaning at the cultural level of aboriginal people. The psychoanalytic theory is ineffectual for people living in an animistic universe. There is no &lsquo;projection&rsquo; since people at this level aren&rsquo;t capable of projection. Whereas in a modern Westerner there is always a little doubt about the veracity of a projection, at the animistic level it is a wholly unconscious phenomenon. The experience of the object comes always from the outside. By example, if the individual is startled when seeing a tree stub in the dark, it means that something has hit him like an arrow from the outside. Whereas a Westerner is prone to immediately withdraw the projection, the animist is convinced that he has experienced a living spirit in the form of a tree stub. He will continue to regard the tree stub or the location with reverence or fear. He is not capable of withdrawing the projection, since the projective function is not part of the animistic form of mental culture. 
<br><br>
How can this aboriginal man possibly be analyzed in terms of transference and counter-transference? The whole theoretical edifice is unfunctional in the animistic context. His psyche is governed by a different psychic economy that is wholly apt in his natural environment, but becomes dysfunctional in a Western society, where he is likely to be diagnosed with a DSM code. However, he should really be understood according to a model of the animistic psyche. We tend to view him as a primitive who is subject to delusions, but his worldview is really grounded in a psychic economy peculiar to his own cultural level. Animism is a wholly healthy and persuasive philosophy of life in its own right. 
<br><br>
In the same vein, Winnicott&rsquo;s theoretical edifice portrays a psychic economy that deviates both from the animistic and the modern projective economy. Arguably, like animism, it represents a stage in the psychic evolution of man. W. describes psychic life as a continual merger with the object to acquire &lsquo;omnipotence&rsquo;, and a subsequent destruction of the same, to acquire &lsquo;unit status&rsquo;. This modus operandi is characteristic of NPD (DSM-IV 301.81), as described by Kernberg, et al. If Winnicott&rsquo;s theory indeed describes the pathological psyche, it means that we are dealing with a psychic economy that deviates from the standard economy of psychoanalysis. The latter is relevant to a patient who is susceptible to &ldquo;interpretation&rdquo;; who reacts with a transference and is capable of withdrawing projections in due order. On the other hand, Masud&nbsp;Khan found Winnicott&rsquo;s theory very persuasive since it rhymed with his own psychic economy. However, outside of his native cultural context, it grew out of proportion. He made himself guilty of many transgressions resulting in his expulsion from The British Psycho-Analytical Society and the International Psycho-Analytical Association (cf. Kahr, 2003).
<br><br>
Winnicott&rsquo;s terms are relevant in criminal psychology. A perpetrator destroys the &lsquo;object of merger&rsquo; in an act of criminal transgression, such as rape. Thus, he succeeds in acquiring the highly wished for &lsquo;unit status&rsquo;. In pagan civilization, destruction in this form was institutionalized as human sacrifice. Typically, it was the most beautiful youths of nobility, or the king himself, who were sacrificed. A handsome person or great warrior was elevated and worshipped as a god, adorned with beautiful clothes and regalia. At a certain date, his chest was pried open and the heart ripped out, as in the Tezcatlipoca sacrifice of Aztec civilization. To us modern people, this enactment represents the epitome of severe mental pathology. Yet in pagan civilization, it was the epitome of godliness and regarded as the finest act of culture. 
<br><br>
W. epitomizes mental health as the ability to engage in subject-object merger, thereafter to tear the &ldquo;object&rsquo;s&rdquo; heart out in an act of destruction. It should be possible to corroborate this mental functioning in those patients whose mental culture is more or less pagan in kind. Yet it is not possible to observe this mental functioning in the general Westerner who can make projections, almost at will, and withdraw them in a whiff. It is relevant that W. takes evidence from historical society. In earlier times, he says, men did only exceptionally attain unit status (cf. Winnicott, 1999, p.&#8239;70). They never went past the symbiotic stage into object-usage, and then on to a more developed object-relation. To convert the object of merger to an object of &ldquo;usage&rdquo; one must follow the example of the child and tear off the teddy&rsquo;s head. Characteristic for a healthy adulthood is the perpetual cycle of merger and destruction of transitional objects. W. says that patients must adopt the way of cyclic destructivity in order to get back on their feet. 
<br><br>
Psychoanalysis cannot build on a singular psychic economy as relevant to all humankind. Comparatively, theologists have established that there are three completely different psychic economies in the Godhead, that is, God is three persons. Theologists found this necessary, as they are mutually exclusive. Psychoanalysts ought follow this recipe, rather than constructing a magpie&rsquo;s nest of several psychic economies that function very differently. They cannot be accommodated under the same roof because they contradict each other. What W. sees as mental health, another author sees as perfectly pathological. If Winnicott&rsquo;s theory allows the analysand to find an outlet of his/her pagan psychic economy, in terms of transitional objects in a transitional field, that is, if it is a method that leads to acculturation, then it is a workable theory. On the other hand, it will lead to very destructive consequences if applied on a patient with a different psychic economy. It is imperative to view mankind as stratified on different levels of mental culture, pertaining to the different epochs of history.
