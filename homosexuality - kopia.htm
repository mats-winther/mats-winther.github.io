    <span class="bigger">Introduction</span><br>
    <br>
    This article explores research findings on homosexuality, examining the debate between viewing it as a natural
    variation in human sexuality versus a developmental condition. By analyzing predominant theories and evidence, this
    review aims to present key scientific perspectives while acknowledging the sociopolitical context surrounding this
    topic. A notable observation in studying this subject is the apparent disconnect between mainstream media
    portrayals and extensive academic research examining psychological factors. While media coverage often emphasizes
    biological determinism, exemplified by authors like Chandler&nbsp;Burr who argue for purely genetic
    origins,&#8239;<sup><a href="#n1."><u>1</u></a></sup> there exists a substantial body of research literature, including
    numerous case studies, that presents alternative viewpoints and more complex explanatory models.<br>
    <br>
    <span class="bigger">Neurotic Family Situation</span><br>
    <br>
    Given that psychologists frequently encounter homosexual clients in their practice, the topic is extensively
    discussed in psychological literature. While perspectives vary across different psychological schools, there is a
    common understanding that views it as an altered development of sexuality, often linked to dysfunctional family
    dynamics. A recurring pattern observed involves an emotionally distant or absent father figure combined with an
    overprotective, psychologically controlling mother.<br>
    <br>
    The validity of these observations can be evaluated through numerous documented case studies. One notable example
    comes from C.&#8239;G.&nbsp;Jung, a pioneering psychoanalyst, who describes what he considers a typical case
    involving a thirteen-year-old girl.&#8239;<sup><a href="#n2."><u>2</u></a></sup> In this case, the father is entirely
    consumed by his professional life while the mother attempts to fulfill her social aspirations through the child.
    Their marriage lacks emotional intimacy. The mother&rsquo;s attention becomes fixated on the child, who faces
    pressure to achieve success to satisfy maternal pride. Consequently, the girl develops neurotic symptoms and begins
    experiencing erotic fantasies focused on her female teacher.</p>
    <blockquote>
      The children of such mothers are practically nothing more than dolls, to be dressed up and adorned at pleasure.
      They are nothing but mute figures on the chessboard of their parents&rsquo; egoism, and the maddening thing is
      that all this is done under the cloak of selfless devotion to the dear child, whose happiness is the sole aim of
      the mother&rsquo;s life. But in actual fact the child is not given a grain of real love. That is why she suffers
      from premature sexual symptoms, like so many other neglected and ill-treated children, while at the same time she
      is deluged with so-called maternal love. The homosexual fantasies clearly show that her need for real love is not
      satisfied; consequently she craves love from her teachers, but of the wrong sort. If tender feelings are thrown
      out at the door, then sex in violent form comes in through the window, for besides love and tenderness a child
      needs understanding.
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="bigger">Homosexual Rights</span><br>
    <br>
    The emergence of psychological perspectives on homosexuality historically contributed to advancing homosexual
    rights. Prior to psychological theories and diagnoses, homosexuality was condemned as either &ldquo;moral
    depravity&rdquo; or attributed to &ldquo;genetic degeneracy.&rdquo; Legal prohibition of homosexual relationships
    led to persecution, blackmail, and various forced interventions including sterilization, lobotomy, and electroshock
    therapy. In many historical contexts (and still in some regions today), homosexuality was punishable by death,
    driving many individuals to suicide.<br>
    <br>
    The contributions of psychologists, including Freud and Jung, who demonstrated that homosexuality stemmed from
    early psychological experiences and internal mechanisms, challenged both religious condemnation and genetic
    determinism theories. This understanding showed that homosexual behaviour wasn&rsquo;t simply a willful choice for
    pleasure, nor was it evidence of genetic defect. This new framework eliminated the logical basis for persecution,
    significantly contributing to the liberation of homosexuals from systematic oppression. Nevertheless,
    discriminatory practices persist in certain American jurisdictions and developing nations.<br>
    <br>
    Therefore, regardless of one&rsquo;s stance on psychological theories, the field deserves recognition for
    establishing a foundation for humane treatment of individuals regardless of sexual orientation. This historical
    context is particularly relevant for homosexual readers, who may hold overly critical views of psychological
    approaches to sexuality.<br>
    <br>
    <span class="bigger">Politicization</span><br>
    <br>
    Contemporary political discourse surrounding this topic has created a paradoxical situation. While many
    institutions continue to teach theories of homosexuality as rooted in developmental factors, mainstream political
    and social commentary invariably presents it as a natural sexual variation. This disparity has led to demands for
    the removal of certain academic materials from universities. The developments in the United States provide an
    illuminating parallel.<br>
    <br>
    In 1973, the American Psychiatric Association (APA)&#8239;<sup><a href="#n3."><u>3</u></a></sup> removed homosexuality from
    its diagnostic manual of psychiatric disorders.&#8239;<sup><a href="#n4."><u>4</u></a></sup> This decision followed an
    intensive campaign by gay rights activists who argued that the psychiatric classification reinforced negative
    societal attitudes and contributed to self-stigmatization among homosexuals. Given the historical context discussed
    earlier, the validity of this argument remains debatable. The decision came after contentious internal debates and
    was ultimately determined by a membership vote, with 58% supporting the removal. This marked an unprecedented
    instance where a clinical diagnosis was determined by popular vote rather than scientific consensus, drawing
    criticism from researchers advocating for evidence-based decision-making.<br>
    <br>
    The declassification did not deter homosexual individuals from continuing to seek psychological treatment. In
    response, the APA issued a 1987 statement declaring that even &ldquo;ego-dystonic&rdquo; homosexuality should not
    be considered pathological.&#8239;<sup><a href="#n5."><u>5</u></a></sup> This meant that even when individuals experienced
    distress about their orientation, it should not be treated as a condition requiring intervention targeting the
    sexual orientation itself. Nevertheless, many APA-affiliated psychologists continued providing treatment to
    homosexual clients, and numerous practitioners maintained their professional viewpoint regarding homosexuality as a
    developmental disorder, despite the official organizational position.<br>
    <br>
    <span class="bigger">Sociocultural Factors</span><br>
    <br>
    The core argument advanced by the APA and gay advocacy groups maintains that the perception of homosexuality as an
    &ldquo;illness&rdquo; stems primarily from sociocultural context. They argue that in a different cultural
    framework, individuals would not be considered deviant and thus would not seek conversion to heterosexuality. While
    this perspective holds some merit, it may oversimplify a complex issue. This approach to ethical and cultural
    relativism led to controversial positions in the 1994 publication, particularly regarding pedophile
    organizations.&#8239;<sup><a href="#n6."><u>6</u></a></sup> The document suggested that the classification of a sexual
    orientation as pathological depends on cultural values, implying that pedophilia should not be diagnosed as a
    disorder unless the individual experiences personal distress about the condition. This position received support
    from an organization advocating for pedophilia legitimization.&#8239;<sup><a href="#n7."><u>7</u></a></sup><br>
    <br>
    This sociocultural interpretation has strong political implications. It positions conversion therapy as unethical
    on the grounds that it reinforces cultural stigmatization of homosexuality. This has sparked intense opposition to
    homosexual therapy in the United States, sometimes taking on dogmatic characteristics. The APA and gay advocacy
    groups frequently assert a lack of evidence supporting successful therapeutic conversion of homosexuals. However,
    this claim appears to conflict with available research evidence. My current review includes multiple rigorous
    research studies and numerous case reports from practicing psychologists across various theoretical orientations.
    These documents indicate that a significant proportion of patients achieved conversion and maintained heterosexual
    relationships in long-term follow-up studies, often in successful marriages.<br>
    <br>
    <span class="bigger">Ideological Worldview</span><br>
    <br>
    The stark contrast between empirical evidence and politically driven narratives evokes parallels with the ironic
    skepticism that emerged in political dictatorships, such as the Soviet Union, where certain facts were deemed to
    &ldquo;not exist&rdquo; by ideological authorities.<br>
    <br>
    Regardless of the validity of psychological explanatory models, it is dogmatic to categorically deny that
    homosexuality could ever manifest as an expression of underlying psychological processes. Dogmatic thinking serves
    only to eliminate doubt entirely, abandoning scientific inquiry in favour of power dynamics. Current efforts in the
    United States to prohibit therapeutic conversion represent a new form of restriction on homosexual individuals, who
    should retain the freedom to explore these questions privately with therapists. The irony of this situation was
    evident in Chicago 2000, where ex-homosexuals demonstrated outside the APA congress, advocating for their right to
    seek therapy.<br>
    <br>
    This context helps explain the striking disconnect in perspectives mentioned at the outset. In Sweden, political
    correctness has fostered an absolute conviction that homosexuality invariably has a biological basis, and that
    genuine conversion has never occurred. This perspective appears to stem from an extensive political campaign that
    established dogmas designed to obscure decades of documented clinical observations in professional literature.
    However, within therapeutic settings, removed from political discourse, a different understanding prevails.<br>
    <br>
    <span class="bigger">Genetic Explanations</span><br>
    <br>
    The psychological perspective might be succinctly captured by Jung&rsquo;s aforementioned observation: &ldquo;If
    tender feelings are thrown out at the door, then sex in violent form comes in through the window&hellip;&rdquo; The
    concept that human sexuality and social functioning can develop atypically during formative years appears plausible
    and is supported by evidence. However, genetic explanations maintain widespread popularity across contexts, as
    exemplified by media coverage of the &ldquo;alcoholism gene.&rdquo; Regarding homosexuality, gay advocacy groups,
    somewhat contrary to historical evidence, maintain that genetic causation would necessarily increase social
    acceptance. Consequently, genetic and neurological findings are often prematurely publicized with excessive
    emphasis.<br>
    <br>
    This is illustrated by the extensive media coverage of neurologist Simon&nbsp;LeVay&rsquo;s research attempting to
    identify distinct homosexual brain structures.&#8239;<sup><a href="#n8."><u>8</u></a></sup> LeVay, drawing on
    Dean&nbsp;Hamer&rsquo;s research,&#8239;<sup><a href="#n9."><u>9</u></a></sup> proposes that homosexual individuals&rsquo;
    hypothalamus is structured similarly to women&rsquo;s, suggesting a genetic basis for this structural difference.
    Additionally, author Chandler&nbsp;Burr asserts that homosexuality originates from the genetic region
    <i>Xq28</i>.&#8239;<sup><a href="#n10."><u>10</u></a></sup> These claims have prompted significant scientific controversy,
    with critics identifying methodological flaws and over-interpretation of data. Scientific American (November 1995)
    published a detailed critique of both the empirical foundations and conclusions.&#8239;<sup><a href=
    "#n11."><u>11</u></a></sup><br>
    <br>
    Several methodological questions remain unaddressed. For instance, could hypothalamic size variations be attributed
    to the effects of AIDS in the deceased subjects? Additionally, the sexual orientation of the deceased subjects
    could not be definitively verified. Current evidence suggests that genetic and neurological explanations for
    homosexuality remain speculative. It is noteworthy that the aforementioned authors and researchers identify as
    homosexual themselves.<br>
    <br>
    <span class="bigger">Brain and Body Effects</span><br>
    <br>
    Claims about structural differences in homosexual brains remain unverified and face contradicting research.
    Moreover, even if such differences were confirmed, this wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily indicate genetic causation.
    Jeffrey Satinover notes that both brain and body undergo measurable changes from childhood experiences,
    particularly traumatic ones.&#8239;<sup><a href="#n12."><u>12</u></a></sup> The brain demonstrates remarkable
    plasticity&#8239;&mdash;&thinsp;for instance, blind individuals who learn Braille develop enlargement in brain
    regions controlling their reading fingers.&#8239;<sup><a href="#n13."><u>13</u></a></sup> Therefore, if limbic system
    differences corresponding to opposite-sex patterns were discovered in homosexual individuals, this could reflect
    early-life acquisition of sexual orientation, typically established by age five. Thus, documented psychological
    environmental influences on brain structure suggest that structural variations in male homosexuals might develop
    during formative years, potentially resulting in more feminine cognitive and functional patterns. However, certain
    characteristic mannerisms likely represent semi-conscious acquisitions forming part of the persona.<br>
    <br>
    <span class="bigger">Multifactorial Explanation</span><br>
    <br>
    Questions of heredity versus environment are highly complex. Satinover provides a particularly cogent analysis of
    genetic interpretation, explaining sexuality&rsquo;s multifactorial nature. This framework acknowledges
    contributions from biological, psychological, and cultural factors. Unlike direct genetic traits such as eye
    colour, behavioural patterns in higher organisms develop through multiple genetic prerequisites interacting with
    environmental and learning factors. Even if certain genetic traits appear more frequently among homosexual
    individuals, possessing such genetic composition doesn&rsquo;t necessarily determine homosexual orientation. Rather
    than seeking direct genetic causation, the relevant question becomes one of degree: what percentage of
    homosexuality is genetically influenced&#8239;&mdash;&thinsp;1% or 30%? Understanding these complex gene-behaviour
    relationships highlights the enduring relevance of psychological perspectives, particularly regarding formative
    experiences.<br>
    <br>
    Using an analogy, genes represent an art student&rsquo;s inherent, limited colour palette. However, the final
    artistic expression varies dramatically depending on influences like mentorship, potentially developing into cubist
    or impressionist styles, while still revealing the artist&rsquo;s distinctive genetic &ldquo;palette.&rdquo; This
    framework helps understand genetic relationships. Media reports suggesting genetic determinism across human
    behaviours warrant skepticism, except for direct traits like eye colour or hair texture. Humans exhibit far greater
    complexity than Gregor&nbsp;Mendel&rsquo;s peas. Even cats require experiential learning to actualize hunting
    instincts. These relationships necessitate continued consideration of psychological perspectives on sexual
    development, as developmental disruptions can impair natural instinctual expression.<br>
    <br>
    <span class="bigger">Twin Studies</span><br>
    <br>
    Twin studies offer potential insight into the genetic contribution to homosexual development. In King and
    McDonald&rsquo;s 1992 twin study,&#8239;<sup><a href="#n14."><u>14</u></a></sup> 46 homosexual men and women (identified
    through an HIV study) participated in research examining their own and their twin siblings&rsquo; sexual
    orientation. The non-concordant sexual orientation in identical twins (75% of siblings heterosexual, compared to
    85% in fraternal twins) indicated genetic factors alone insufficiently explain development of sexual
    orientation.<br>
    <br>
    This study&rsquo;s credibility is enhanced by its participant source, as it is unlikely to harbour political
    motivations. While methodological limitations may exist, the data, if reasonably accurate, challenges theories of
    innate sexuality, particularly given the minimal difference between identical and fraternal twin correlations (25%
    versus 15%).<br>
    <br>
    Bailey and Pillard&rsquo;s 1991 study,&#8239;<sup><a href="#n15."><u>15</u></a></sup> the largest to date, examined 56
    identical twins, 54 fraternal twins, 142 biological brothers, and 57 adoptive brothers, with at least one
    homosexual brother per pair. Results showed homosexuality concordance in 52% of identical twins, 22% of fraternal
    twins, 9.2% of biological brothers, and 10.5% of adoptive brothers. Science (December 1993) suggested these
    findings support environmental rather than genetic determination.&#8239;<sup><a href="#n16."><u>16</u></a></sup> Notably,
    biological brothers sharing 50% genetic material showed lower concordance than adoptive brothers with no genetic
    similarity. Fraternal twins, genetically equivalent to regular siblings, demonstrated higher concordance,
    suggesting environmental influence. The 52% concordance in identical twins, sharing nearly identical genes and
    upbringing, appears low for genetic determination.<br>
    Overall Impression<br>
    <br>
    The higher concordance in identical versus fraternal twins might reflect their complete similarity leading to more
    uniform environmental experiences and social responses. However, these studies warrant caution. Larger sample sizes
    would strengthen conclusions. Bailey and Pillard&rsquo;s recruitment of twins for their sexuality study through gay
    publications may not represent the broader twin population, as it could over-select for twins where both members
    identify as gay. Additionally, non-responding twins&rsquo; orientations were reported by their participating
    brothers, possibly further skewing concordance rates.<br>
    <br>
    While Kallman&rsquo;s 1952 twin studies showed higher correlation, these findings are now considered
    invalid.&#8239;<sup><a href="#n17."><u>17</u></a></sup> The mere presence of genetic influence proves little, as genes
    invariably play some role. The critical question is whether genetic determination is sufficient to classify
    homosexuality as constitutional. Current evidence appears insufficient to support this conclusion.<br>
    <br>
    <span class="bigger">Hormonal Hypothesis</span><br>
    <br>
    The extent to which genetics influence sexual orientation is still uncertain, as the expected level of concordance
    for homosexuality among identical twins has not been conclusively determined. However, if prenatal hormonal factors
    were solely responsible, both identical and fraternal twins should show near 100% correlation due to shared
    prenatal hormonal environment. While hormones influence sex-specific development, the hormonal hypothesis lacks
    credibility as a comprehensive explanation for human sexuality. Attempts at hormonal therapy for heterosexual
    modification have proved unsuccessful. Perloff conclusively identifies homosexuality as a psychological
    phenomenon.&#8239;<sup><a href="#n18."><u>18</u></a></sup><br>
    <br>
    Recent research examining increased homosexuality among younger brothers yielded results consistent with
    psychological models. Historically, younger sons more frequently become emotionally dependent on mothers, while
    firstborn sons typically align with fathers. Additionally, increasing parental discord over time exposes younger
    siblings more frequently to factors associated with psychological theories of homosexual development.<br>
    <br>
    Nature (March 2000) reported a statistical correlation between homosexuality and shorter index fingers, attributed
    to prenatal hormonal exposure.&#8239;<sup><a href="#n19."><u>19</u></a></sup> While this doesn&rsquo;t support hormones as
    an exclusive cause, it suggests their potential role in increasing developmental probability. Cases of
    hormone-induced hermaphroditism&#8239;<sup><a href="#n20."><u>20</u></a></sup> and transsexualism fall outside the scope of
    this investigation.<br>
    <br>
    <span class="bigger">Cultural Anthropology</span><br>
    <br>
    Lacking strong constitutional evidence, could homosexuality be purely cultural? Anthropologists observe harmonious,
    non-neurotic characteristics in many traditional societies. Burenhult notes the absence of homoeroticism in modern
    Trobriand Islands,&#8239;<sup><a href="#n21."><u>21</u></a></sup> while Margaret&nbsp;Mead reported similar findings in
    original New Guinea cultures: Arapesh and Mundugumor.&#8239;<sup><a href="#n22."><u>22</u></a></sup> If accurate, these
    observations suggest culture&rsquo;s primacy in sexual development.<br>
    <br>
    Some anthropological perspectives contrast health issues in modern societies, like heart disease, jealousy, and
    sexual violence, with traditional societies that ostensibly lived more naturally and did not exhibit those
    problems. This viewpoint conflicts with sociocultural models, which consider all human behaviours as natural and
    see culture as simply providing frameworks for evaluating those behaviours. The sociocultural perspective proposes
    that various behaviours have persisted throughout history but have been suppressed by cultural norms at different
    times. In contrast, the anthropological view suggests culture fundamentally shapes human behaviour, including
    sexuality. According to some anthropological accounts, certain traditional societies like early 20th century Samoa
    existed without neuroses, deviations, or homosexuality. However, the evidence for lack of homosexuality in such
    societies remains contested.<br>
    <br>
    <span class="bigger">Stereotyping Explanations</span><br>
    <br>
    The anthropological view of traditional societies as free from neuroses and homosexuality parallels utopian social
    concepts like those proposed by Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses. However, Margaret&nbsp;Mead faced criticism about
    potential biases in her methodology and interpretation of data on sexuality in Samoa.&#8239;<sup><a href=
    "#n23."><u>23</u></a></sup> She later acknowledged the need to carefully evaluate claims by native peoples about the
    absence of homoeroticism in their societies. Challenges include language barriers, cultural taboos discussing
    sexuality, retrospective changes in narratives, and tendencies to provide expected responses to researchers. Some
    observers note that non-conforming individuals often faced elimination in traditional societies, so outward harmony
    may have masked underlying oppression. Enforced societal homogeneity can prove destructive despite appearances of
    contentment. Claims about lack of homosexuality in any society require careful scrutiny of methods and data.<br>
    <br>
    Davenport&rsquo;s study of 636 Melanesians&#8239;<sup><a href="#n24."><u>24</u></a></sup> highlights the challenges in
    defining homosexuality across cultures. While the community reported no exclusively homosexual individuals, they
    did acknowledge occasional same-sex sexual contact among married persons considered heterosexual. Notably, four
    unmarried men existed in the society&#8239;&mdash;&thinsp;two rejected for infidelity and known for same-sex
    behaviour, and two citing poverty for not marrying. Additionally, two unmarried women claimed fear of childbirth.
    While these explanations rely on stereotypes, they suggest the possibility of underlying same-sex attraction. The
    study illustrates the difficulty in conclusively determining the presence or absence of homosexuality in a culture
    using Western definitions and perspectives.<br>
    <br>
    <span class="bigger">Cultural Variations</span><br>
    <br>
    While claims of homosexuality&rsquo;s complete absence in traditional cultures remain unproven, anthropological
    observations reveal significant cross-cultural variation exceeding what repression alone might explain. Ford and
    Beach described how the occurrence of temporary sexual relationships between persons of the same sex varied across
    cultures, being common in some societies while rare in others.&#8239;<sup><a href="#n25."><u>25</u></a></sup><br>
    <br>
    Mead argues that the sexual harmony in Samoan culture stems from their child development practices and extended
    family structures.&#8239;<sup><a href="#n26."><u>26</u></a></sup> She suggests that having a broad network of adult role
    models helps guide youth development, even if their biological parents are less involved. This highlights how
    cultural factors like family conditions and social environments can shape sexuality. It seems that homosexuality
    was relatively uncommon in hunter-gatherer societies that make up 99% of human history,&#8239;<sup><a href=
    "#n27."><u>27</u></a></sup> implying its higher prevalence today may be a more recent phenomenon. Apache culture
    provides an example of a balanced psychosocial environment due to their clear gender roles and equal parental
    involvement for children.<br>
    <br>
    <span class="bigger">Animal Studies</span><br>
    <br>
    Although homoerotic behaviours have been observed in animals, researchers have traditionally been cautious about
    drawing conclusions since individuals often still exhibit heterosexual behaviours as well.&#8239;<sup><a href=
    "#n28."><u>28</u></a></sup> For example, male dolphins may attempt contact with younger males, typically after
    unsuccessful heterosexual encounters. While Bagemihl identifies homoeroticism in 450 species,&#8239;<sup><a href=
    "#n29."><u>29</u></a></sup> his broad definitions may equate social bonding behaviours in animals to human
    homosexuality. behaviours like male lions rubbing manes or chimpanzees making mouth-to-mouth gestures likely serve
    social functions rather than sexual ones, similar to human cultural practices such as cheek kissing. More evidence
    is needed before correlating these observation to human sexuality.<br>
    <br>
    <span class="bigger">Misimprinting</span><br>
    <br>
    There are anecdotal examples of how seagulls of the same sex live together for a period of time. Whether this can
    illuminate human homosexuality is unclear. Desmond&nbsp;Morris confirms that males in certain bird species can be
    artificially misimprinted by being separated from females during development.&#8239;<sup><a href="#n30."><u>30</u></a></sup>
    The misimprinting, which sometimes means that male birds build nests together, is difficult to break. In nature,
    such phenomena are very rare. In Morris&rsquo;s work, consistent biologism leads to the conclusion that
    homosexuality in humans is a &ldquo;misimprinting,&rdquo; and not natural. But drawing strict parallels between
    animals and humans inevitably leads to an oversimplified view of human sexuality.<br>
    <br>
    <span class="bigger">Bonobos</span><br>
    <br>
    Among primates, we find more interesting examples of social behaviour, as discussed in Bagemihl&rsquo;s book about
    the bonobo ape.&#8239;<sup><a href="#n31."><u>31</u></a></sup> This ape, distantly related to chimpanzees, has been
    portrayed in the popular press engaging in continuous sexual orgies. However, according to Bagemihl,
    pseudocopulation occurs once per 1.5 hours and lasts on average 13 seconds.&#8239;<sup><a href="#n31."><u>31</u></a></sup>
    The leading expert in the field, Franz&nbsp;de&nbsp;Waal,&#8239;<sup><a href="#n31."><u>31</u></a></sup> emphasizes that the
    behaviour&rsquo;s primary function is an expression of sympathy, even if there can be a mixing with sexual
    feelings. This behaviour serves to avoid conflict and strengthens social bonds among bonobos.<br>
    <br>
    Males also engage in penis-rubbing against each other, a behaviour that could be compared to rhythmic handshaking
    among humans. Interestingly, bonobos perform a copulating motion even against their children, which strengthens the
    empathic bond between individuals. However, it cannot support the naturalness of pedophilia from a human
    perspective. Bagemihl&rsquo;s interpretation of this behaviour with one-sided, sexual glasses might underestimate
    animals&rsquo; emotional life and complexity. As with dogs&rsquo; embarrasing &ldquo;humping&rdquo; behaviour, we
    should approach these observations with an open mind and avoid projecting our own human values and interpretations
    onto their actions.<br>
    <br>

    Bonobos lack pair bonding and the nuclear family structure, distinguishing their sexual behaviour from humans.
    Baboons may provide more relevant insights into human homosexuality. In baboon troops, some adult males who
    haven&rsquo;t achieved dominance or access to females form stable relationships with younger males, who appear to
    serve as female substitutes psychologically.&#8239;<sup><a href="#n32."><u>32</u></a></sup> These partnerships involve
    protection for the younger male, and observers have documented mating postures and mutual genital contact, though
    without climax. The dominant male typically seeks female partners when circumstances permit. This pattern parallels
    some psychological theories that view homosexuality as an alternative pathway when heterosexual development faces
    obstacles. However, interpreting these behaviours purely in sexual terms requires caution. The bonds between older
    and younger baboons might primarily serve emotional and social functions, similar to mentor-student
    relationships.<br>
    <br>
    Animals often display pseudosexual behaviours and postures that function to strengthen social bonds and reduce
    aggression. Some biological theorists have proposed that homoeroticism evolved from a social submission instinct,
    as exemplified in young male baboon behaviour.&#8239;<sup><a href="#n33."><u>33</u></a></sup> This hypothesis attempts to
    resolve why exclusively homosexual genes would persist despite natural selection pressures against them, as a
    social submission instinct would offer survival advantages. However, this remains a speculative proposal requiring
    further evidence.<br>
    <br>
    <span class="bigger">Archetypal Explanation</span><br>
    <br>
    Robert Hopcke, a homosexual scholar, proposes a distinctive theory supporting constitutional
    homosexuality.&#8239;<sup><a href="#n34."><u>34</u></a></sup> His theory builds on the concept that the psyche isn&rsquo;t
    blank at birth but contains innate archetypal models. While sexual development is partially shaped by external role
    models, Hopcke argues for the existence of innate psychological patterns beyond mere instincts. These innate
    models, or archetypes, include male, female, and androgynous forms, with the latter serving as a template for
    homosexuality. He points to the widespread occurrence of transvestite shamans and priests across cultures as
    empirical support. These shamans often adopted feminine attire and vocal patterns during rituals, exemplified by
    the berdache shamans of Native American cultures.<br>
    <br>
    However, this theory faces significant challenges. Most shamans, like modern transvestites, were likely not
    homosexual.&#8239;<sup><a href="#n35."><u>35</u></a></sup> Furthermore, Hopcke overlooks that berdache were typically
    selected in childhood.&#8239;<sup><a href="#n36."><u>36</u></a></sup> These chosen individuals were separated from their
    communities and initiated into both shamanic practices and feminine roles, including dress. Psychological research
    suggests that such early gender identity inversion commonly leads to homosexual development, indicating the
    berdache phenomenon might reflect environmental rather than constitutional factors. The feminine presentation of
    shamans could alternatively represent a symbolic transcendence of earthly existence through androgynous identity,
    establishing a spiritual &ldquo;third gender.&rdquo; Taylor suggests the berdache tradition may derive from the
    cult of the mother goddess, where priests were expected to exhibit feminine characteristics.&#8239;<sup><a href=
    "#n37."><u>37</u></a></sup><br>
    <br>
    <span class="bigger">The Mother Dependency Theory</span><br>
    <br>
    According to prevailing psychological models, homosexual development often correlates with intense maternal
    bonding. Clinical studies commonly describe a consistent dynamic: an overprotective mother who creates emotional
    dependency, paired with an emotionally distant or absent father. This pattern illustrates what psychologists
    describe as homosexuality&rsquo;s &ldquo;reparative&rdquo; function&#8239;&mdash;&thinsp;a psychological adaptation
    to navigate away from an emotionally challenging childhood environment. Bieber&#8239;<sup><a href=
    "#n38."><u>38</u></a></sup> provides the following example:</p>
    <blockquote>
      The patient&rsquo;s mother was more close-binding intimate and overprotective than warmly affectionate. His
      father, pleasant but detached and ineffectual, was dominated by his wife.&nbsp;[&hellip;] He was said to be a
      &ldquo;lovely&rdquo; boy. Always trying to please, he never took a stand in an argument.&nbsp;[&hellip;] In his
      early school years, his isolation from male peers persisted. He played with girls and often played alone with
      dolls. He was called a &ldquo;sissy.&rdquo; Once his teacher asked him and a little girl who lived near-by to
      stay after school to clean up. His arrival home late and in the company of a girl greatly upset his mother who
      thought surely something sexual must have occurred. The only time he recalled a beating from his father, who also
      threatened to take him to the police, was when the patient and a girl were discovered inspecting each
      other&rsquo;s genitals. It had been the mother who had urged the father on, but during the whipping she implored
      him to stop.&nbsp;[&hellip;] At the age of thirteen he met a slightly older boy who became the first person
      outside the family with whom he had a continuing relationship albeit a homosexual one. He was compulsive about
      engaging in this secret act and tried to meet his partner at every available opportunity. He feared his mother
      might in some way see through him, find out, and pounce upon him. There was a great turmoil when, some six years
      later, he made it obvious to his parents that he was having a homosexual affair. They were very distressed and
      worried about what the neighbors would think. He stood his ground and quietly moved out. &ldquo;I thought my
      mother would collapse when she found out I moved.&rdquo; She could not believe her son would dare flout her
      control, nor could she believe he had the strength to assert himself against her. She predicted that he would
      come &ldquo;crawling back&rdquo; in less than a week. Vindictively, she froze the funds of their joint bank
      account.&nbsp;[&hellip;] During sessions when he talked of his father he summed up his opinion of him with the
      comment, &ldquo;He was a nothing.&rdquo;
    </blockquote>
    <p>This case illustrates several key patterns in psychological development. The dominant mother creates significant
    obstacles for the son&rsquo;s psychological separation from early maternal identification. The ineffective father
    fails as a role model and lacks the strength to facilitate the son&rsquo;s separation from maternal influence.
    Figuratively, it represents an umbilical cord needing to be severed.<br>
    <br>
    This developmental challenge particularly affects male children. Boys must achieve more complete maternal
    separation than girls to establish their identity. While mothers naturally serve as role models for daughters, sons
    require a fundamental break from the early mother-child symbiotic relationship. This more dramatic separation
    process carries higher risks of developmental complications, potentially explaining the higher prevalence of
    homosexuality among males.<br>
    <br>
    Hudson and Jacot propose that the psychological wound from maternal separation shapes fundamental differences in
    male and female cognitive and behavioural patterns.&#8239;<sup><a href="#n39."><u>39</u></a></sup> Their research suggests
    that men tend to develop more abstract thinking patterns and emotional detachment from concrete reality, while
    women maintain more grounded, holistic perspectives. This separation process may enhance the male&rsquo;s
    enterprising mindset, his adventurousness and aggression, but can also result in more psychologically
    unidimensional development.<br>
    <br>
    <span class="bigger">Male Peer Groups and Development</span><br>
    <br>
    The concept of &ldquo;maternal liberation&rdquo; primarily represents a psychological
    transformation&#8239;&mdash;&thinsp;a fundamental shift in the young man&rsquo;s psyche that transcends infantile
    consciousness. This internal psychological process parallels external behavioural changes. As
    Anthony&nbsp;Storr&#8239;<sup><a href="#n40."><u>40</u></a></sup> explains:</p>
    <blockquote>
      It is characteristic of this pre-adolescent phase that boys gang up together and shun the company of girls whom
      they despise as inferior beings. It is a time when affirmation of the male role is being sought; and, just as in
      primitive societies women are excluded from male initiation rites, so, in our own, there has to be a time when
      the boy severs his tie with the opposite sex in order to establish himself as male. Women have to be put in their
      proper place before a man feels strong enough to deal with them; and the exaltation of his own sex combined with
      the denigration of the opposite sex is part of the process by which a boy emancipates himself from his mother and
      learns to take his place in the world of men.<br>
      <br>
      The homosexual male has been unable to take this step for the reasons outlined above, and so remains in a
      condition in which not only are women shunned but in which men remain emotionally important to him. The essential
      feature of male homosexuality is the persistent adoration of the masculine rather than the feminine. It is the
      emotional attitude of the boy who looks up to men but cannot feel himself yet to be one of them.
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="bigger">Family Disruption and Development</span><br>
    <br>
    Donald J. West emphasizes that maternal binding is not the sole cause of homosexual development.&#8239;<sup><a href=
    "#n41."><u>41</u></a></sup> Various impediments to heterosexual development can produce similar outcomes. For instance,
    maternal loss may lead boys to seek paternal affection through assuming a surrogate spouse role. This highlights
    the crucial importance of balanced masculine role models in a boy&rsquo;s environment, including not only fathers
    but also traditionally masculine figures such as firefighters, police officers, teachers, and older male
    students.<br>
    <br>
    Marie-Louise von Franz observes an increasing prevalence of mother-complex issues in modern
    society,&#8239;<sup><a href="#n42."><u>42</u></a></sup> particularly noting the rise in homosexuality-manifesting maternal
    attachment. She frames this phenomenon within broader cultural development, identifying an underlying religious
    dimension. The rise of broken families, where fathers become marginal figures, raises concerning implications.
    Contemporary society lacks compelling ideals that could serve as psychological guideposts. Traditional religious
    frameworks, now largely diluted and antiquated, no longer function effectively as paternal ideals. Instead,
    materialistic thinking predominates&#8239;&mdash;&thinsp;essentially a primitive form of mother-attachment. The
    modern welfare state functions as a surrogate mother goddess. This parallels ancient matriarchal societies, where
    homoeroticism emerged as a form of protest against the dominant feminine goddess.<br>
    <br>
    Historical evidence shows periodic surges in homoerotic expression, a phenomenon challenging purely biological
    explanations while supporting psychological models. Psychoanalyst R.&nbsp;Schärf&nbsp;Kluger examines the
    &ldquo;epidemic increase&rdquo; of male homoeroticism during matriarchal periods.&#8239;<sup><a href=
    "#n43."><u>43</u></a></sup> She explains this as male libido concentrating inward to dissolve maternal attachment
    (broadly defined). Kluger concludes that homosexuality fundamentally relates to mother-attachment, with male libido
    seeking and projecting virility onto other men.<br>
    <br>
    <span class="bigger">Mythological Perspectives</span><br>
    <br>
    A controversial historical-cultural interpretation suggests male homosexuality represents a developmental stage in
    masculinity&rsquo;s evolution from feminine divine dominance. In Erich&nbsp;Neumann&rsquo;s view, primitive hero
    archetypes manifest as handsome young protagonists like Tammuz, Attis, Adonis, and Narcissus, who were unable to
    overcome the dominance of mother goddesses.&#8239;<sup><a href="#n44."><u>44</u></a></sup> This perspective partially
    validates Hopcke&rsquo;s archetypal explanation: these divine youths, like homosexual men, attempt escape from
    feminine influence but remain mother-bound. Ancient Athens exemplifies this dynamic, where increased pederasty and
    misogyny coincided with unprecedented cultural advancement.<br>
    <br>
    This perspective suggests that male artistic and intellectual achievement historically flourished when societies
    moved away from goddess worship and concomitant worldly values, such as beauty and prestige. According to this
    view, a man who subordinates himself to the feminine spirit risks having his creative potential stifled. The
    argument frames male autonomy from women as essential for realizing creative and cultural contributions. When
    Western civilization became established, the mother goddess no longer posed a threat, and homoeroticism and
    misogyny receded.<br>
    <br>
    <span class="bigger">Mirror-Seeking Behaviour</span><br>
    <br>
    Psychological theory suggests healthy heterosexual development involves finding complementary traits in
    opposite-sex partners. Conversely, homosexual individuals often seek an idealized
    self-image&#8239;&mdash;&thinsp;the mother-liberated man they aspire to become. Liberace
    (1919&#8239;&ndash;&thinsp;1987) exemplifies this pattern: compensating for maternal dependency through flamboyant
    masculine display while encouraging his partner to surgically mirror his appearance. This dynamic offers
    <i>partial</i>&thinsp;&thinsp; liberation from maternal attachment, representing what several psychologists describe as an
    emergency solution. Storr says that &ldquo;<span class="nobr">[t]he</span> homosexual&rsquo; fear of women springs
    from his difficulty in breaking clear of his mother. For him, to become emotionally involved with a woman is to
    retreat once more into arms which may be loving but which form a prison from which he has in any case only
    partially escaped.&rdquo;&#8239;<sup><a href="#n45."><u>45</u></a></sup> While preferable to complete developmental
    stagnation, this narcissistic resolution remains fundamentally incomplete.<br>
    <br>
    <span class="bigger">Dependency and Power</span><br>
    <br>
    Lionel&nbsp;Ovesey elucidates the psychological foundations of homosexuality.&#8239;<sup><a href="#n46."><u>46</u></a></sup>
    While the maternal attachment and associated fear of women as sexual beings form the sexual component, two
    additional Oedipal elements&#8239;&mdash;&thinsp;dependency and power&#8239;&mdash;&thinsp;are relevant for both
    homosexual and heterosexual men. Warren&nbsp;Steinberg makes similar observations.&#8239;<sup><a href=
    "#n47."><u>47</u></a></sup><br>
    <br>
    It&rsquo;s widely recognized that defeat in power dynamics is often unconsciously interpreted as homoerotic
    subjugation. This is reflected in American cinema&rsquo;s frequent use of sodomitic metaphors, such as
    &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bust your ass!&rdquo; An illustrative example is when a distinguished member of the Swedish
    Academy bursts into a newspaper office declaring: &ldquo;You have ass fucked me!&rdquo; Ovesey notes that this
    symbolism extends to other primates, where subordinate males may display feminine posturing and rear presentation,
    mimicking mating behaviour. Men experiencing workplace humiliation and powerlessness sometimes dream of assuming
    similar submissive positions. According to Ovesey, homosexuals actualize this psychological pattern rather than
    maintaining it as verbal posturing like heterosexual men.<br>
    <br>
    The mother complex, within this framework, represents an unconscious yearning for childhood-like dependence and
    nurturing. To avoid regression, a substitution occurs where penis equals breast. The incorporation of a presumably
    powerful man&rsquo;s penis, either orally or anally, is perceived as transferring masculine strength to the
    recipient. Thus, while the fantasy appears to compromise masculinity, it paradoxically serves to reinforce it.<br>
    <br>
    Some primitive cultures feature rituals where initiates consume the father&rsquo;s seminal fluid wrapped in leaves.
    Among the Hottentots, young men would, after ritually acquiring masculine power, engage in intercourse with their
    mothers, thereby reducing her status from &ldquo;mother&rdquo; to &ldquo;woman&rdquo; and temporarily breaking free
    from the mother complex. Psychodynamic psychologists suggest that such archaic fantasies persist in our unconscious
    and serve as templates for homosexual individuals&rsquo; magical reparative measures. However, this solution fails
    to achieve a complete separation from maternal influence. The following case demonstrates these archaic reparative
    fantasies,&#8239;<sup><a href="#n48."><u>48</u></a></sup> where the father&rsquo;s penis is symbolically incorporated and
    magically employed to repair the young man&rsquo;s perceived inadequacies, extending beyond sexual contexts:</p>
    <p></p>
    <blockquote>
      Anal incorporation can be illustrated by the masturbation fantasy of a patient who developed an ambidextrous
      technique for simultaneous genital and anal masturbation. He manipulated his penis with one hand while he pumped
      a thermometer in and out of his anus with the other. In the fantasy that accompanied this act, he imagined
      himself sandwiched between his mother and father as they were having intercourse. The father&rsquo;s penis
      entered the patient&rsquo;s anus, emerged as the patient&rsquo;s penis, and then penetrated the mother&rsquo;s
      vagina.
    </blockquote>
    <p>Both passive and active roles manifest in homosexual behaviour. While some individuals prefer the receptive
    &ldquo;feminine&rdquo; position, others, from a psychological perspective, counteract their inner sense of
    inadequacy by displaying exaggerated masculinity. This spectrum is exemplified by the contrast between
    &ldquo;queens&rdquo; and &ldquo;butch queens&rdquo;. However, these represent two aspects of the same psychological
    dynamic, and most homosexual individuals experience both passive and active roles.<br>
    <br>
    <span class="bigger">Mythological Mother</span><br>
    <br>
    The absent or negative father figure appears so frequently that many contemporary therapists consider the
    disruption of father-son bonding the primary factor in homosexual development. While maternal overattachment can
    develop from father absence independently, peer group dynamics often play a contributing role. The child&rsquo;s
    psyche may develop and maintain primitive fantasies with or without maternal psychopathology. Jung&#8239;<sup><a href=
    "#n49."><u>49</u></a></sup> proposes that many psychological effects attributed to maternal influence actually stem from
    the child&rsquo;s unconscious archetypal projections, which can transform the mother figure into either an
    idealized or demonized mythological entity.<br>
    <br>
    However, exposure to a nurturing father figure and engagement with conscious fantasy can dissolve such mythological
    projections. This allows fantasies to develop within conscious awareness rather than remaining fixed in the
    unconscious, preventing the reparative behaviours Ovesey describes. Children can successfully navigate challenging
    childhood circumstances when supported by a rich spiritual and cultural framework that nurtures their fantasy life,
    such as folklore. Given that few children experience ideal upbringings, developing a robust self-healing fantasy
    life during their imaginative years is crucial for avoiding adult complexes. Once individuals reach adulthood and
    adopt rationalistic thinking patterns, influencing these unconscious fantasies becomes more challenging, resulting
    in the formation of complexes.<br>
    <br>
    <span class="bigger">Absent Fathers</span><br>
    <br>
    The absence of paternal role models emerges as a consistent theme across research findings.
    Aardweg,&#8239;<sup><a href="#n50."><u>50</u></a></sup> Bieber,&#8239;<sup><a href="#n51."><u>51</u></a></sup>
    Kronemeyer,&#8239;<sup><a href="#n52."><u>52</u></a></sup> West,&#8239;<sup><a href="#n53."><u>53</u></a></sup> and
    Westwood&#8239;<sup><a href="#n54."><u>54</u></a></sup> all document that homosexual men, primarily due to absent or
    negative father figures, developed unusually intense maternal relationships, leading to maternal identification and
    failed paternal identification. Westwood&rsquo;s study of 127 male homosexuals is particularly noteworthy as it
    excluded therapy patients. This addresses the common criticism that homosexuals seeking therapy might be neurotic
    for independent reasons, potentially skewing the interpretation of homosexuality as inherently neurotic.
    Westwood&rsquo;s findings suggest that these family dynamics exist even among non-patients.<br>
    <br>
    Research consistently identifies the negative father image as a statistically significant factor. Abusive or
    violent fathers can trigger an aversion to masculine nature in sons. Saghir and Robins document a predominantly
    negative father image among their subjects.&#8239;<sup><a href="#n55."><u>55</u></a></sup> Guy&nbsp;Corneau observes that
    present, loving fathers enable young men to develop positive body image and pride.&#8239;<sup><a href=
    "#n56."><u>56</u></a></sup> He suggests that homosexuality can function as a ritual for reclaiming positive body
    awareness, particularly for those with traumatic paternal relationships. Aligning with this perspective, Layland
    argues that homoerotic fantasies in men stem from yearning for paternal love.&#8239;<sup><a href=
    "#n57."><u>57</u></a></sup><br>
    <br>
    The absence of positive, authoritative father figures appears central to the issue. Modern society&rsquo;s
    relativistic nature makes it difficult for young men to find strong, positive male role models outside the family
    unit. Even religious leaders struggle to maintain firm positions, leaving a concerning vacuum often filled by
    extreme ideologies. Problems in a child&rsquo;s immediate family frequently exacerbate gender identity issues. For
    example, alcoholism, overbearing mothers who control their children, and disengaged fathers who ignore gender
    nonconforming behaviours in their kids can all disrupt a child&rsquo;s process of developing a gender identity.<br>
    <br>
    Disrupted self-perception typically originates from poor parent-child relationships. When childhood emotional needs
    remain unfulfilled, they risk becoming eroticized during early puberty. This framework suggests that homosexual
    attraction often represents a search for authentic parental love, with individuals seeking paternal or maternal
    love through same-sex relationships. Jung comments on a specific case:&#8239;<sup><a href="#n58."><u>58</u></a></sup></p>
    <blockquote>
      Yet the longing for a man&rsquo;s leadership continued to grow in the boy, taking the form of homosexual
      leanings&#8239;&mdash;&thinsp;a faulty development that might never have come about had a man been there to
      educate his childish fantasies. The deviation towards homosexuality has, to be sure, numerous historical
      precedents. In ancient Greece, as also in certain primitive communities, homosexuality and education were
      practically synonymous. Viewed in this light, the homosexuality of adolescence is only a misunderstanding of the
      otherwise very appropriate need for masculine guidance.
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="bigger">Psychotherapy</span><br>
    <br>
    Regarding the potential for change in sexual orientation, Sigmund&nbsp;Freud initially expressed skepticism about
    therapeutic success with homosexual patients. However, his daughter Anna&nbsp;Freud soon documented a 50%
    conversion rate among 8 patients.&#8239;<sup><a href="#n59."><u>59</u></a></sup> Irving Bieber&rsquo;s rigorous 1962 study
    challenged the pessimistic outlook.&#8239;<sup><a href="#n60."><u>60</u></a></sup> Among 106 homosexual/bisexual individuals
    undergoing psychoanalysis, 27% achieved exclusive heterosexuality, confirmed through long-term follow-up studies.
    Notably, 19% transitioned from exclusive homosexuality to exclusive heterosexuality. Independent researchers have
    corroborated these findings.<br>
    <br>
    Mayerson and Lief&rsquo;s study of 19 homosexual individuals showed that after an average of 4.5 years, 22% had
    transitioned to exclusive heterosexuality, with 47.3% showing significant improvement.&#8239;<sup><a href=
    "#n61."><u>61</u></a></sup> Masters and Johnson reported a minimum success rate of 43.2% in their follow-up study of 67
    patients.&#8239;<sup><a href="#n62."><u>62</u></a></sup> NARTH&#8239;<sup><a href="#n63."><u>63</u></a></sup> conducted an interview
    study of 882 former homosexuals, including 726 who underwent professional therapy.&#8239;<sup><a href=
    "#n64."><u>64</u></a></sup> This study reported a 33% success rate, with only 13% remaining exclusively homosexual
    post-treatment. However, the study&rsquo;s methodology, based on patient surveys, doesn&rsquo;t meet full
    scientific rigor.<br>
    <br>
    Additional research supports similar conclusions, though some reported success rates warrant scrutiny. For
    instance, Kronemeyer&rsquo;s claimed 80% conversion rate, despite his specialization in homosexual therapy,
    requires careful consideration.&#8239;<sup><a href="#n65."><u>65</u></a></sup> His results weren&rsquo;t presented in a
    formal scientific format. While many therapists report individual cases, these often lack comprehensive scientific
    documentation, including proper follow-up studies.<br>
    <br>
    The evidence suggests that success rates for transition to exclusive heterosexuality approximate those for treating
    acute mental health issues. Significantly, even when complete conversion isn&rsquo;t achieved, substantial
    improvements often occur. These improvements may include abandoning destructive, promiscuous behaviours and
    developing artistic or religious interests. Jolande&nbsp;Jacobi emphasizes this therapeutic aspect, noting that
    even without full conversion, relative improvements often occur, leading to enhanced moral living.&#8239;<sup><a href=
    "#n66."><u>66</u></a></sup><br>
    <br>
    Effective homosexual therapy requires making patients conscious of archaic reparative fantasies and developing
    intellectual understanding of these patterns. Discontinuing homoerotic behaviour may trigger painful manifestations
    of the unconscious mother complex; but this confrontation is necessary for complex integration and resolution. Many
    therapists emphasize the importance of addressing fear of the opposite sex as a sexual being, which frequently
    manifests as an almost phobic aversion to female genitalia. Some psychologists advocate overcoming this phobia
    through willful sexual engagement with women. Self-directed therapy can sometimes prove effective.<br>
    <br>
    <span class="bigger">Conclusion</span><br>
    <br>
    Constitutional models of homosexuality face a significant limitation: they fail to account for the strong
    statistical correlation between homosexuality and absent/negative fathers or dominating mothers. If hormonal
    factors were primary, such clear psychological patterns should not emerge. Researchers promoting constitutional
    theories often disregard childhood environmental data. The possibility of therapeutic conversion also challenges
    purely constitutional explanations.<br>
    <br>
    While some cases may have constitutional origins, others appear psychogenic. Attempts to establish genetic and
    hormonal bases have proven difficult to replicate and often display theoretical and methodological weaknesses.
    Psychological studies demonstrate greater replicability, and twin studies provide limited support for strong
    genetic or hormonal determination.<br>
    <br>
    Sexual development involves genetic, familial, and cultural factors. Unlike the copulation instinct among simple
    creatures, human sexuality has strong psychological foundations and is significantly influenced by learning and
    environment. The existence of specific fetishes demonstrates that sexual preferences cannot be purely genetic.<br>
    <br>
    Kernberg has challenged the assumption that homosexuality is inherently natural, noting its frequent association
    with narcissism and borderline pathology.&#8239;<sup><a href="#n67."><u>67</u></a></sup> Judd&nbsp;Marmor and colleagues
    view homosexuality as an ego-adaptation to challenging circumstances.&#8239;<sup><a href="#n68."><u>68</u></a></sup> This
    adaptation may represent the best available option compared to alternatives like narcissistic masculinity, passive
    dependency, or psychopathy. Similar to how psychopathic traits can emerge as an adaptation to a criminal
    environment, homosexuality may arise as a logical response to certain environmental conditions.<br>
    <br>
    M-L von Franz&rsquo;s assessment of homosexuality as fundamentally rooted in spiritual underdevelopment appears
    valid. It represents a neurotic rebellion against mother-bondage in a materialistic society focused on security.
    This reflects a spiritually impoverished culture unable to reinforce paternal values of moral uprightness and
    authentic spirituality, leading to family instability. Therefore, homosexuality cannot be viewed solely as an issue
    pertaining to the individual. A purely therapeutic approach addresses only symptoms. The phenomenon indicates
    broader societal existential issues, with homoeroticism representing a collective call for elevated consciousness
    beyond materialistic existence.<br>
    <br>
    As a personal observation, homosexuality may unconsciously serve to establish outsider status, facilitating
    individual development in an increasingly conformist culture. This outsider position has potentially contributed to
    homosexuals&rsquo; achievements in various fields. Paradoxically, complete normalization might diminish this
    creative impetus. The push for complete normalization may therefore be misguided.

    male homosexuality</i>. The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease, 115: pp.&#8239;283-298 (1952). The study
    included 85 pairs of twins where at least one brother was homosexual. Of the 40 pairs of identical twins, both
    brothers were homosexual. In the group of fraternal twins, more than half of the homosexual twins had a
    heterosexual brother. Pairs point out that one can therefore not draw the conclusion that heritability is a
    dominating factor. He notes that Kallman&rsquo;s scientific work has been subjected to fierce criticism
    (Pare,&nbsp;C.&#8239;M.&#8239;B., <i>Etiology of Homosexuality: Genetic and Chromosomal Aspects</i>
    <i><u>in</u></i>&thinsp;&thinsp; Marmor (ed.), Sexual Inversion, 1965). Marmor is also very suspicious of Kallman&rsquo;s
    information and notes that his twin studies in the fields of schizophrenia and tuberculosis have been refuted
    (Marmor, <i>Introduction</i>&thinsp;&thinsp; <i><u>in</u></i>&thinsp;&thinsp; Sexual Inversion, 1965). Kallman has in a similar way produced
    astonishing statistics by independently selecting patients and diagnosing schizophrenia himself. In the study on
    homosexuals, Kallman made the selection mostly from mental patients, which can also distort the result. No later
    study has managed to reproduce this striking correlation.<br>
